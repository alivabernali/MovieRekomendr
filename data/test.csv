Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery 2022;10; Feel like I've been in crazytown for the past month after a certain bird app event so this movie is exactly the antidote I needed.

The Adventures of Tintin 2011;10;  The best Uncharted movie ever made. And probably‚Äì bear with me, here‚Äì Spielberg's funniest movie. The medium lets him play with gags so much more and it's clear he's having a blast with it. So much fun, he gave us the BFG and Ready Player One. Kenny Rogers was so real about knowing when to fold 'em.It's also one of the‚Äì keep bearing with me here‚Äì Spielberg-iest Spielberg movies, if that makes sense?

Bones and All 2022;10; A bit bowled over at how Guadagnino captures what is isolating about the wide open spaces and end-of-the-line hamlets of the rural midwest. A landscape ravaged by an opioid crisis, inhospitability towards queer people, political ideological rot, inherited family trauma, and innumerable broken homes, and the cannibalism could be a representation of any (or none!) of those things. A movie about the places you run away from but can never manage to escape.

Eyes Wide Shut 1999;10;  100Pretty definitively my favorite Kubrick, although I do the slightest double-take whenever I give another glance towards 2001 or Barry Lyndon. He made a handful of masterpieces, but this is the only one where Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman smoke a joint and argue about the ambiguities of jealousy and sex and married life. It's also the only one with Todd Field in it. A flawless film from beginning to end. Larry Smith's DP work is unreal. All of‚Ä¶

Skinamarink 2022;4;  You _really_ need to be immersed for this movie to work, like you gotta watch it alone without lights. Not even as like a 'challenge', but just because the movie is so slow and the shots are so ambiguous it's very easy to lose your attention. If you watch it with friends, you guys are just gonna be talking the whole time like "OH whats that? is that a face? wait what room is this? have we seen this corner‚Ä¶  
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery 2022;10;  So so so so fun to watch this with an audience, and with the foresight of what‚Äôs to come. Clearly, Netflix only allowed a theatrical run because they know the real value in this movie is that it necessitates a rewatch (unlike 95% of their catalog!)Man oh man is this a beautiful movie!

Bones and All 2022;6;  hmmm very pretty and was ultimately won over by the finale but left feeling like it shouldn‚Äôt have taken that long to get there, the build-up to it is just a bit too¬†vague as romance and tasteful as horror which kinda dulls the perverse effect merging the two is supposed to have. it constantly has its characters talk about their largely off-screen addiction/attraction to the ugliness but you never really feel it, and its aversion to full-on indulging in the‚Ä¶

Triangle of Sadness 2022;6;  gonna give this one the light pass because i liked it more than the square and kinda respect it taking the near-parody levels of controlled, euroart satire of that film to a few legitimately funny, anarchic and gross-out extremes. i just miss when his comedic observations of social/physical behavior were contained to intimate character dynamics (like in force majeure) instead of these painfully broad mouthpiece sketches that Make You Think. because when he wants to be ostlund is a pretty‚Ä¶

It doesn‚Äôt deliver on being 90 minutes though, and if you‚Äôre gonna take time away from David Harbour bashing people‚Äôs heads in, the subplot better be some damn good cinema (spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not).

The Menu 2022;8; I‚Äôm glad The Menu¬†never takes itself too seriously, because the movie is at it‚Äôs best when it gets extremely goofy, which is often. The story may veer into the predictable side of things, but like the film‚Äôs ornate food presented to its posh patrons, it‚Äôs all about the *journey*. It‚Äôs always a treat to see the elite get humiliated, but high brow foodie culture needs to get dunked on more often and The Menu¬†is maybe the best (or at least my favorite) to do it.

Guardians of the Galaxy 2014;10; I forgot how fucking good this movie was. Goddamn I really miss the early days of the MCU. Shit ignited my passion for cinema and defined most of my high-school/early college experiences.Phase 4 feels like the part of the movie when the mentee returns to the old once-wise mentor only to find that he‚Äôs become a raging alcoholic and a very very small shadow of his former self.

The Illusionist 2006;4; we have the prestige at home. 
Bones and All 2022;8;  All of us have heard stories about how some movies are so disturbing that they cause individuals to pass out in theaters. And I, like many others, assumed it was all a hoax. Probably The Exorcist, but many of the other stories seemed simply marketing schemes.But then...There I was, in the theater, watching this film like any other, and I was feeling great.

The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special 2022;8; There‚Äôs something undeniably charming and heartwarming about a Marvel project with no villain and no agenda beyond just making the audience feel warm and fuzzy inside.Good shit. Made me miss the good ol‚Äô days when the MCU was more character-driven and simplistic in its execution. 
The Menu 2022;8; The Menu is the work of filmmakers raging against the system in which art is created. These guys fucking hate everyone: the critics, the fanboys, the finance guys, the repeat customers. Hell, even the culture of adulation and cult-like worship that forms around the directors themselves.This movie hands out brutal takedowns like Oprah handing out cars in 2004. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as the guy who is too old for this shit. I loved it.

Four Flies on Grey Velvet 1971;10;  "Four Flies on Grey Velvet" is an early 1970's film directed by Dario Argento. Although Argento had been involved within other areas of filmmaking for some time, "Four Flies" marks only his third film (and third inclusion within his early 'Animal' trilogy) directed up to that point. It is absolutely acknowledged that in this early phase, Argento cut his teeth on the highly stylized Italian genre of Giallo. Giallo, meaning "yellow" in Italian (which has etymological leading back to the‚Ä¶

Emancipation 2022;6;  An over-inflated B movie with little gold delusions of grandeur, Antoine Fuqua‚Äôs thoroughly Oscar-pilled ‚ÄúEmancipation‚Äù is the kind of immaculate misfire that could only happen because Hollywood is spinning off its axis. Because the American film industry has sacrificed medium-budget programmers at the altar of monolithic franchise blockbusters, original stories can only expect to be told if they feed into the awards machine and/or manufacture a sense of cultural significance.

Earth Girls Are Easy 1988;8;  "Earth Girls Are Easy" is 1988 musical comedy that features some wayward aliens in a "fish out of water" scenario.

Petite Maman 2021;8;  Celine Sciamma continues her study, her search for what makes us human. Something the filmmaker has been doing from nearly the start of her career. This time, though, she sets aside the sexual themes and instead focuses on the root of it all: childhood itself.In this case, we have the story of a daughter seeking to connect with her mother in a way she had previously been unable to do. This is accomplished through the use of a way‚Ä¶  
A Breed Apart 1984;6;  Starring: The Wicked, Charming, Dutch Icon Rutger HauerHauer plays the role of the ultimate Vegan Rambo: a mountain man with an immense, lethal love of wildlife who will do anything to stop anyone from harming them.

Bones and All 2022;6;  Guadagnino does have a real knack for capturing the beautiful but empty atmosphere of America's open roads and the interchangeable midwestern states that are defined by the avenues leading through them. But at every point that this film reaches a fork in the road where it might have taken a path toward something truly rich and meaningful, it just keeps buzzing along like a distracted driver missing his exit.

Spetters 1980;8;  Starring: The Wicked, Charming, Dutch Icon Rutger HauerCount on Verhoeven to deliver the most hopeless, sexually charged, depressing coming-of-age film about bikers. There are more penises in this movie than in any other mainstream, and they get in the way of just about every scene and hole imaginable. Despite their obnoxiousness, you can't help but feel sorry for the protagonists, especially this one in particular that gets stuck in a wheelchair after an accident as a result of being‚Ä¶  
The Creeping Flesh 1973;8;  The Creeping Flesh begins with an institutionalised Peter Cushing introducing the concept of evil as a matter of science. We then flashback to the story of how he got there, which involves a giant skeleton found in New Guinea and his half brother Christopher Lee's mental hospital. The film is a rather quaint affair especially for 1973, it feels every bit like something Hammer would have put out in the early sixties. The slow pace and lack of action may‚Ä¶

Chanel Solitaire 1981;6;  Starring: The Wicked, Charming, Dutch Icon Rutger HauerOnce again, our hero Rutger Hauer makes full use of his charming and romantic side in a little role as one of Chanel's lovers/friends in a film. After all is said and done, this is a Timothy Dalton/Marie-France Pisier film, they're both excellent in their roles, and they have nice chemistry together. Pisier, in particular, nails the style icon's sophisticated attitude.My main gripe is that it looks, sounds, and plays like‚Ä¶

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  Stunning filmmaking. If there was ever streaming film that deserved a theatrical release on premium format screens, it is this. From the opening gorgeous frame, to the harrowing and chaotic action set-pieces, the claustrophobic trench warfare, and the tank sequences, there is so much to behold. The bombastic score blares in, jarringly at first, with a three note phrase followed by silence. This unresolved phrase is a recurring motif that creates this truly unsettling tension whenever it‚Äôs used throughout the‚Ä¶  
Aftersun 2022;10;  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I guess I just feel a bit down or something.‚Äù-Sophie-Aftersun is a beautiful, tender, and utterly crushing contemplative journey through the tainted and wishful memories of a bereaved daughter. Aftersun is a heavy and emotionally draining outing, with each scene slowly unraveling and revealing the darkness that casts a large shadow over the film‚Äôs entirety. It‚Äôs uneasy.

Persona 1966;8; This 4/5 star rating is temporary as I feel I need to rewatch this film in order to give a more accurate rating‚Ä¶Bergman creates a very stress-inducing environment in this psychological drama, backed by 2 performances that hold up incredible well.

The Usual Suspects 1995;2; a dated film out of the dated genre of one-trick-flicks of the years around 2000. Spacey and Singer as now morally convicted elements of crime make this a fun watch in meta-terms, but as a movie itself this won't keep up historically. being heavily overhyped in the late 90s, this audience wind-up will be forgotten in 20 years from now.

He also conveys the intended message on male chauvinism and ego neatly through lighthearted moments and effective dialogues. Karunas, Kaali Venkat and Redin Kingsley play their roles to perfection.

The Eternal Daughter 2022;8;  A Joanna Hogg horror starring Tilda Swinton is an intriguing enough setup on its own.

Triangle of Sadness 2022;6; See, this is exactly why I avoid taking vacations on multimillion dollar yachts. It never ends well! (If you think that joke is bad, you should hear some of the ones in the first half of this movie. The second half is okay.)

Bullet Train 2022;8; 2022 RankedIt felt like I was watching a Guy Ritchie film which is as big of a compliment as I can give. It did overstay it‚Äôs welcome though and could have been shorter. All the cast were brilliant, script was funny and the action was very good. My MVP was either Joey King or Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

Mystery Men 1999;8;  "Mystery Men" is a 1999 comedy focusing on a group of misfitted superheroes. The original source material came from independent comic book writer and artist Bob Burden with his breakthrough "Flaming Carrot" character. While the primary Flaming Carrot character is not featured, his side character team, which became an ensuing spin off series, the "Mystery Men", became the featured focused build that would lead to this film. The Mystery Men were always more superhero hopefuls rather than the actual application‚Ä¶

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; Ridiculously fun and over the top in just the right way! The cameos are out of control. Daniel Radcliffe is hilarious. Simply one of the most entertaining movies of the year! 
Coffy 1973;8;  Pam Grier is here to say a lot of cuss words and kill a lot of people in her revenge mission against drug dealers. This one felt more graphically violent than Foxy Brown and more technically competent as well. Several of the actions scenes are shot pretty effectively and the use of fake bodies to be used in the carnage made the film felt even more violent. Pam's Coffy will not stop until the people responsible for killing her sister‚Ä¶

Disenchanted 2022;4; Disney stop making legacy sequels challenge 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; I think sad, sensitive and dumb Colin Farrell is my new favourite type of Colin Farrell, maybe even more than leaked sextape Colin Farrell.Sadly, having a row with your best friend is something I know plenty about, so a lot of this movie hit quite close to home, however, it didn‚Äôt stop me from appreciating how wonderful it was. Such great humour and writing, and characters played to perfection by the talented cast.I enjoyed it a lot. Very funny and touching. 
Down by Law 1986;10; Tom Waits learns that he might be cool, but he'll never be Roberto Benigni jailbreaking and escaping through the Luisiana bayou hunting rabbits and picking up beautiful women in the middle of nowhere cool. 
The Tree of Life 2011;8;  It feels bizarre even giving this a rating, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I didn‚Äôt. Definitely a cliche, but if there is one film to fit the ‚Äúit‚Äôs an experience, not a film‚Äù saying, it is this one. It manages to convey so many emotions, whilst not having one main narrative. The plot is so free form to the point of it almost being non-existent. An experimental film on the meaning and creation of life centred on‚Ä¶  
Emancipation 2022;4; EMANCIPATION is a well-intentioned but hollow misfire. Will Smith gives himself over fully, turning in a physically grueling performance of resilience. Works better as a survival film than anything else but even that becomes banal. Was not a fan of the desaturated cinematography. 
The Masque of the Red Death 1964;8; My first Roger Corman directed Edgar Allan Poe movie and what a doozy it was. Highlights include Vincent Price's performance as the satanic cult leader (it seems like he was having a ball making this), and Nicholas Roeg's lavish cinematography (wow, those colours üòç).A big thanks to Michelle for introducing me to this wonderful movie.A real (visual) treat. 
The Menu 2022;4; The Menu is the only film bold enough to ask the question: what if Ratatouille was directed by Ari Aster but with a half-baked execution and was neither as fun nor sharp as it thought it was?

Dead for a Dollar 2022;6; can't really begrudge anyone who finds the late style here to be low-rent dress-up but i kinda love how committed hill is to the old-fashioned simplicity that feels like it would've even been a bit uncool in like the 60s. 
Violent Night 2022;8; If you want a silly, violent, and over the top Christmas action thriller where you can see Santa beat the living shit out of people during this holiday season, then this is the film for you.¬†I won‚Äôt be mad if we get more films like these on the regular basis. 
Meet Me in St. Louis 1944;8; When Judy Garland's character says she hates basketball, surely she isn't referring to the 2022-23 Boston Celtics, what with their record-breaking offense and MVP play from Jayson Tatum! 
Skinamarink 2022;10;  Three weeks ago, I had no idea this film existed.Two weeks ago, it was at the top of my watchlist.One week ago, I achieved the means to watch it.Today, I am a changed man.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a film gain such legs purely through word of mouth like Skinamarink has.

There are many adaptations some faithful to the text, some pornographic, others striving to be a film. Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre breathed fresh air into a classic which is difficult to pull off.

Dazed and Confused 1993;10; ... No Dazed November is finally over! 
Meshes of the Afternoon 1943;10; Quite possibly the most perfectly realized dream (logic) movie in existence. Anyone with an interest in surrealist cinema needs to search Meshes of the Afternoon out. It's only 14 minutes long and it can be viewed on YouTube.*Deren and Hammid were an obvious influence on certain future filmmakers (I feel like this guy is at least somewhat familiar with their work).*Originally a silent film, there are many versions available with complementary Foley sounds/ a soundtrack. I watched this one. 
Love Actually 2003;8; Of all the modern rom-coms I have seen, this is one of the more entertaining ones. Granted, I haven't seen that many but still. Love Actually gave me plenty of laugh out loud moments and I became very vocal each time one of the characters did something crazy or stupid. Speaking of characters, how stacked is this movie?! Absolutely insane how many people show up in this, if only for a small cameo. Bonkers!I had the best time watching this with Michelle and Sophie. 
Branded to Kill 1967;8;  Criterion Collection Spine #38(Foreign Language Film - Japanese)A stylized fever dream into the yakuza's pecking order of assassins."Don't mock me, damn it!

While it did take me a while‚Ä¶  
Bones and All 2022;10; all the bad dreams that you hide, show me yours, i‚Äôll show you mine. 
Black Girl 1966;8;  African cinema at its finest. Black Girl explores the complex, painstaking relationship between France and Africa, via the vessel of an African girl whose "French dream" slowly shatters after moving to France and working for a white family.When it comes to technicalities, Black Girl may not be the showiest of its era, but the perfect understanding of the topic it tries to cover, and the unmistakable African identity are what ultimately sell it in the end. In this highly‚Ä¶  
Mysteries 1978;6;  Starring: The Wicked, Charming, Dutch Icon Rutger HauerIn this soapy gothic mystery picture, Hauer reprises his role as a lovely yet enigmatic man without becoming a complete creep but sometimes has this machiavellian side. His chemistry with Kristel is excellent as well, particularly in that he is charming while being emotionally aloof.This film has excellent cinematography. The film's look reminds me of a Lawrence Gordon Clark ghost story, down to the colors, which works wonderfully for this particular‚Ä¶  
Bones and All 2022;8;  What a film, maybe one of the best of the year.I‚Äôm sure these comparisons have been made but this cannibalistic love story with bite (heh) and heart fits pretty neatly (or as sloppy as one of the ‚Äúmeals‚Äù in the film) between NEAR DARK & TROUBLE EVERY DAY and also stands apart as truly romantic.The leads are really effective, making the core love story work and earn those tears at the end.Never thought Mark Rylance could be so‚Ä¶  
The Football Incident 1976;8;  On The Road: The Dutch Frontier - Windmills, Bicycles, Decks and Questionable PlacesWhen it comes to outstanding Dutch filmmakers, Joris Ivens is a name that consistently tops the list. Particularly due to his interest in human subjects, but with an approach that is typically a little more experimental, his documentaries have been able to capture the attention of critics and cinephiles alike.I chose this piece out of all the ones I could find, admittedly because it was one‚Ä¶

The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg 1927;8;  Take a visit to Lubitschland, where manners don‚Äôt just make a man, they also form the basis of love.¬†‚ÄúThe Student Prince in Old Heidelberg‚Äù is the crowning piece of the Ernst Lubitsch‚Äôs silent era. The film depicts a romance between a young monarch and a beer hall kellnerin (waitress). While the boy begins as a rowdy Prince Hal-esque figure, he gradually matures, and realizes he must weigh the importance of true love against the future of the entire kingdom.¬†‚Ä¶

The Trouble with Harry 1955;6;  The Trouble with Harry is certainly the oddball movie of Alfred Hitchcock's filmography. The film begins with the discovery of a corpse in the woods, and from there numerous characters become involved believing they may have something to do with it. The film is an absurd comedy. The corpse at the centre exists only as a dilemma - the fact that somebody has died never really enters into it, with the practicalities of the situation taking centre stage as the‚Ä¶

The cinematography, in particular, is excellent. And Sharlito is fantastic as Ted, and the option to view everything through his perspective lets us appreciate (sometimes even partly agree, though never with the‚Ä¶

After receiving blood from a mysterious origin, he finds himself miraculously healed, but the cost is that he is turned into a vampire - a definite conflict of interest with his profession and world view.¬†Thirst is a unique tonal blend of darkly comic and dramatically intense.

The Enlightenment was a 17th and 18th century philosophical movement that sought to understand the world through empiricism and rationality.
