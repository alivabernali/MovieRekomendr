Black Adam 2022;4;  The question that “Black Adam” poses is a simple one: What happens when Hollywood’s most risk-averse movie star collides with Hollywood’s most risk-averse movie genre? The answer provided by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s depressingly inevitable (and inevitably depressing) foray into the superhero-industrial complex is, of course, even simpler: Exactly what you’d expect. Only worse.All due respect to whatever unique and illustrious history Black Adam may have developed since his DC Comics debut in 1945, but the lifeless spectacle that…

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  Probably MacDonagh’s opus to me. Fascinating to see someone whose work I have generally thought of as bitter, cynical, and spiteful (in a clever and entertaining way) confront the way that bitterness, cynicism, and spite isolate and destroy people by deadening the things that kept their kindness afloat. And it’s so funny!! Everyone involved is at the top of their game but I’m particularly impressed by Colin Farrell. I don’t know how or why he looks so different here than…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; The parts of this that click do so very well but honestly its emotional swings work better on paper than in practice, it's in desperate need of narrative momentum, and the central conflicts lack the first one's galvanic thorniness. Also, without spoiling it, the best scene in the movie has the unfortunate side effect of reminding you of just what is missing here.link textjust what is missing here.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  The last thing that we see Chadwick Boseman’s King T’Challa do in 2018’s “Black Panther” is appear before the United Nations, where he reveals to the world that his African nation of Wakanda has secretly been a superpower for several thousand years. While the character would go on to appear in some other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies before the actor who played him succumbed to colon cancer in August 2020 — an illness that Boseman had endured with almost Wakandan…

Halloween Ends 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   72Can't quite put this up there with the 2018 reboot, but this romantic, vampiric slasher drama is far beyond the senseless motions and rhythms of Halloween Kills. It's purposeful and tragic and unique. David Gordon Green and team have developed a trilogy that honestly doesn't work well at all as a cohesive statement, but each piece is distinctive. With Halloween Ends, the cosmic, fuming lifeforce of Michael Myers in Kills proves to be short-lived. His hatred is weakening within…   
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; They took the "forever" in Wakanda Forever literally, because this film feels like eternity.

Halloween Ends 2022;6; They should’ve stopped making Halloween movies after the first one (or at least after the third), but if they’re gonna keep making unnecessary reboots and sequels forever then at least make some weird choices with then(this movie makes a lot of weird choices) 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Ryan Coogler is a gifted filmmaker who knows how to fuse epic blockbuster scope with personal concerns. Wakanda Forever’s opening sequences, which address Boseman’s passing, are very moving, as is the movie’s first act, which follows his grieving loved ones (and, by extension, the actors playing them) as they try to move on with their lives following T’Challa’s (and Boseman’s) sudden death. From there, all of the intricate details of Namor’s history and schemes swamp the plot, overtaking most of…

Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; “A Russian capitalist and an American communist.” “On a $250 million luxury yacht.”Fucking perfect. Roy Andersson presents White Floatus. So loaded and smart and makes every possible correct turn in a way that made me absolutely giddy as the credits rolled. Lost my shit (yeah) at a flawlessly-executed, cartoonish “talking” toilet gag mid-movie that really settled me into knowing I was watching a high brow, low brow masterpiece. One of my favorites of the year!“From each according to his ability, to each according to his need?” 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  A movie drenched in so much love and passion, even it’s glaring flaws never fully sour the experience. This is not to imply the bad outweighs the good, because there’s so much Wakanda Forever gets right. Coogler double downs on the world building and absolutely nails it- Talokan is bursting with life and Namor owns every second he’s on the screen, easily one of the better MCU villains in some time. Its real issue is that it attempts to take on…  
Aftersun 2022;10; It’s hard to find something to write for this. There’s so many things going wrong with my life right now so many things I wish I could change so many things I’ll never change never get to change and never be able to change but I hope I’ll get better and stay better. This might just be my favorite movie of the year and it’s something I’ll need to remember for the rest of my life and make sure I do better for myself and the people around me

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER is a moving tribute to Chadwick Boseman & a powerful continuation of his legacy. Everyone ups their game from the first film with standout performances from Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett & Tenoch Huerta, improved visual effects & an awesome score. The world building for the undersea nation of Talokan is fascinating. I especially loved the use of practical water effects. How the story continues the first film’s themes & expands on them is also really thoughtful & well done. Considering the…

Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Carpenter has said he never intended the Halloween franchise to go beyond the first film, and after watching Halloween Ends I agree with that sentiment wholeheartedly.There have been moments over the years of absurdity in the Halloween films but the ideas David Gordon Green presents here and the fact that they were green lit, takes the cake.  This was a dull, illogical, dimwitted affair that did the legacy of Michael Myers a disservice.  When you struggle to find one…  
Pearl 2022;10; Many movies have been colloquially dubbed “Joker For Women,” but this is the only one that actually earns the title. She’s a star. She’s a star, she’s a star, she’s a star. She is a big, bright, shining star.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  From my Vulture review:“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever carries a series of burdens no one film could ever bear. Its director, Ryan Coogler, must grapple with the challenges and expectations born and influenced by the tragic death of star Chadwick Boseman. Coogler must craft an entertaining sequel to a billion-dollar blockbuster while working within the constricting Marvel Cinematic Universe. He must carefully balance the expectations of Black folks who have elevated the film to a celestial status — a pinnacle…

And through all that time, Laurie Strode lived the life of a paranoia survivalist. She never got over it. She never relaxed. All she knew was fear and rage.Then Michael Myers actually did escape. He went on another killing spree. He killed Laurie’s daughter! As this sequel begins, he remains at large. No one knows where he is. He could potentially return at any moment.…

In the climactic action scene he pours a barrel of gasoline on a bad guy…but no longer has the match in his mouth. He just takes one out of his pocket and lights the guy on fire. This is a HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY for an amazing payoff where the match that’s been right there the whole movie becomes the weapon that finishes off a bad guy. Come on, Sly.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4; A movie about real grief trapped within the confines of a pre-written (and more importantly pre-vis’d) story about fake grief, jerry-rigged to be about both and winding up a sort of double negative. A director striving for moments of real artistry trapped within the studio confines of second unit management, Iron Man helmet-cam interjections, and arbitrary post-credits sequences. The most forward-thinking thing here is that Coogler and Cole predicted a world where a man is reprimanded for receiving illegal intel by way of vibrating beads. Uncanny stuff all around.

Halloween Ends 2022;2;  can’t tell you if evil did in fact die tonight but what I can say is that my soul absolutely did. What the hell happened here? David Gordon Green started out so strong with Halloween, giving fans a mean and new brooding look at Michael Myers. Halloween Kills was at least fun and fucking gnarly but also quickly became tedious with “who is actually the monster” narrative, but Halloween Ends, the movie that should have taken the mean yet nostalgic…

Don't Worry Darling 2022;6;  I liked the film but it wasn’t perfect. Let’s start with the positives. Florence Pugh is stellar in this, it’s a career best turn from her. She was magnificent. Chris Pine as well killed it, he was brilliant. Harry Styles was good as well. The cinematography was STUNNING. Every shot deserved to be framed, honestly mesmerizing. The production design and costumes were really fantastic too. The problem with the film was that it was too heavy handed and predictable and…

Evil Dead II 1987;10; No film better captures that horror and comedy are essentially the same genre than this masterpiece. Every scare and joke works the same way: timing and surprise. One time I put this on and clocked how much of this movie is "normal", the answer is, about two minutes. From then on, it's NON STOP mayhem, goofs and spoofs, pranks and bits. This movie represents everything that filmmaking should aspire to.

The Iron Lady 2011;2;  this has one unfortunately holds a permanent slot in my brain because meryl streep beating rooney mara in girl with the dragon tattoo for playing girlboss margaret thatcher at the oscars was one of my first experiences with truly loathing a movie as a high schooler. the depiction here of her ghoulish austerity policies as a tough but pragmatic truth done in the name of brave, noble servitude from someone who actually earned their position and everyone even only marginally…  
TÁR 2022;10;  taken aback by how much i liked this, but i'm always primed to dig something this proudly, confrontationally slow (unlike the man to my right who was loudly snoring before the opening scene even ended). i get why everyone is discussing this in a Cancel Culture context but man i think that's the worst part of the thing. it's basically impossible to talk seriously about cancel culture and not sound like a hysterical moron and the brief dips this film…  
Terrifier 2016;6; I can see why audiences were SPLIT down the middle on this one 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever suffers from a giant, Chadwick Boseman-shaped hole that it can’t fill, no matter how many characters, storylines, and muddled, chaotic action sequences it tries to throw on the screen. In the wake of the actor’s shocking 2020 death from cancer, returning director Ryan Coogler, who wrote the script with Joe Robert Cole, chose not to turn inward with a smaller, reflective film on the loss of Boseman’s Black Panther. The character’s death is central to the…  
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;8; dang, GDT dropped that little wooden freak right into WWII-era fascist Italy! Pinocchio in his Porco Rosso era (call that Porcorocchio), but instead of his companion being the most beautiful woman in the world, it's the most beautiful cricket in the world (Ewan McGregor, who sings an original song, as does... Christoph Waltz?!).oh, and Lydia Tár plays a monkey. perfect voice cast that directly appeals to me. GDT knows i've been burned too many times by the 12 other Pinocchio movies released within the past year. thank you king for reforming the Pinocchio-industrial complex. now we can finally abolish it :)

TÁR 2022;10;  exquisite. a fully realized vision from page to screen. to label this film in almost any way is to do a disservice to its complexity, and the complexity of the topics at hand. there is no otherworldly finger wagging at the audience, the kinds of recent movies lacking depth that all but scream at us, “look here, think this, and feel badly about it”. the art vs the artist conversation has very rarely, if never, been seen through such a…

Wendell & Wild 2022;8; Incredibly fun and creative. Loved the characters, voice acting and the animation which was PHENOMENAL. Some plot elements were a bit too big to be explored here but the world was too rich for me to care honestly. Henry Selick has done it again

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2;  ryan coogler is arguably the best director to bother working in the kevin feige machine, but he really shouldn't have made this, because all the minor flaws in the original are magnified here to ridiculous proportions. these movies remind me a lot of 80s/90s action movies where the villains will make some salient political points just so they can be completely destroyed by our establishment-adjacent heroes for daring to question the current status quo, wakandan or otherwise. this is one…

TÁR 2022;10;  90“Time is the thing.”First and foremost an epic of institutional guilt. The devolution of Lydia Tár is designed for our current cultural conversation, but the basis doesn’t start and end with a mere character study, and the context of her classical music profession is a pivotal detail. Todd Field’s latest film is eager to expand and explore the creative environments surrounding Lydia, and the actor/director collaboration here pushes past the limits of subjectivity in search of tougher, more…

Werewolf by Night 2022;8; Hey Marvel, this is what happens when you give someone an ounce of creative freedom to execute their vision. Giacchino creates a visually haunting and beautifully shot piece of fiction paying homage to classic monster/horror films. While we never push the boundaries of true horror and scares, Giacchino's practical effect work and creative decision to shoot this in Black and White add to the atmospheric nature of this "film".This is better than every Disney Plus MCU show we’ve gotten and it was done in 55 minutes.

Bullet Train 2022;2; one of those shitty guy ritchie knockoffs updated for the epic meme era. so insane to me that this tries to pull off some melancholy beats about revenge or fate or whatever while also being written like deadpool and shot like kingsman, a literal child's idea of what cool adult movie style is just like those 90s movies but now with awful cg. who are the people out here having sincere emotional reactions to characters who won't stop going "holy freaking shitballs" and" eat a bag of dicks, fucknuts" every few seconds? depressing to watch a real movie star like pitt debase himself like this. 
Weird Science 1985;6; Eight minutes into this movie two teen boys hack into a government power facility. They aren’t even tech geniuses, they just, like, own a computer.(not a complaint, just an observation) 
Aftersun 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I kept waiting for something drastic. I thought the father might walk out and never come back. I thought he might die and that's why the need to recollect, the need to explore, the need to see in between the lines to see what wasn't explicitly expressed. I thought this would be an explosive story in its quiet nature and yet it wasn't. We do get a clear idea that the father is no longer in the daughter's life, but…   
Mad God 2021;4;  40There's a massive difference here between admiring all of the blood, sweat, and tears clearly poured into this hellish passion-project, and ultimately how successful it is as a film. No one, especially me, is disputing the barrage of grimy detail, the depths of its Boschian landscapes, its fantastical array of memorable creatures and freaks and weirdos. It's gorgeous to look at. But I struggled to latch onto this admittedly impressive demo-reel in any significant form. The monotonous pacing is…

Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;8;  Just as it might be said that every anti-war film is unavoidably still a call to arms, every documentary that promises an unvarnished look into the private life of a mega-famous pop star is unavoidably still a mouthpiece for its subject’s personal brand. And yet, a small handful of them are sincere and curious enough to also become something more at the same time. “Miss Americana” leveraged Taylor Swift’s celebrity into an arena-sized portrait of self-doubt in the digital age,…

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10; ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is the most terrifyingly realistic depiction of war on film since Saving Private Ryan. A bleak, brutal onslaught on the senses with an immersive soundscape & astonishing cinematography.

Black Adam 2022;6;  Black Adam is another generic superhero movie in a long line of generic superhero movies. Strangely, I found almost every other character much more interesting than the titular character, a character whose dialogue I’m fairly positive was written by a child. Maybe it’s canon for Black Adam to only deliver one-liners, if that’s the case then congrats on the comic accuracy. I suppose the movie’s saving grace is the action, which is prevalent and inundated with needle drops and slow motion,…

I can handle the truth.  almost ashamed to admit that this evoked what was likely my biggest laugh in a theater this year during a 30 second long shot of someone projectile vomiting. it peaked for me in the second act but has a solid conclusion and a few great editing choices that i’m excited to revisit later. probably too long but i didn’t feel the runtime in the slightest. would pair well with lanthimos‘ the lobster  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  i almost have to admire how big of a swing it is to do a trilogy full of rote legacy sequel fan service building up to The Final Showdown and then have 75% of the last movie be about some random dork. on paper it's not the worst concept for a Halloween sequel (the opening titles imitate Season of the Witch's title font, suggesting a similar departure from formula) but this movie is just so painfully boring. i only started…

V/H/S/99 2022;6;  V/H/S/99 Is the latest addition to the found footage horror omnibus franchise, and it mostly works.This sub-genre has been slowly evolving since it’s inception and here it traverses more into the comedy realm.  This time it nixes a through narrative for a handful of stop motion segments that makes it feel like your watching Adult Swim.  Revenge seems to be the theme in this outing and while there are always standouts it’s also very uneven. A little more…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Yeah. I’m glad this exists, even if I don’t love it all the way through.It does get weigh down by the messy storytelling, the many plot lines going on at once, some weird character motivation and editing choices in the second act, and not allowing some of the more compelling themes enough time to flesh out as they should. But the animation, voice acting, decent cast of characters, it’s creativity and imagination, and the third act made the experience worthwhile. Far from perfect, but a fun time to watch for this spooky time of the year. 
Barbarian 2022;8; Absolutely filthy movie structured near-perfectly to play with its audience and make them scream. Justin Long pulling out the tape measure might be the hardest laugh this year, had the whole theater dying.

Halloween Ends 2022;8; The most interesting Halloween sequel (outside of Season of the Witch) ever made. David Gordon Green you goofball.You can’t kill the boogeyman. Evil as a contagious disease in the age of COVID, and a portrait of suburban rot and pathetic American incel rage run wild. And no matter how evil Michael Myers is, the people of Haddonfield are worse, and they think they’re better, and that’s why they’re so bad.

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  All Quiet on the Western Front is the best war film I’ve seen in quite some time, arguably standing alongside 1917 and Hacksaw Ridge as one of the best this decade. Not often are films made from the German perspective, let alone make you sympathetic towards the soldiers. Yet it’s an approach that worked wonders for me. These men weren’t monsters, simply soldiers under order of a deranged man. That’s what makes All Quiet on the Western Front one of the…

Don't Worry Darling 2022;6;  It’s unfortunate how mediocre Don’t Worry Darling turned out to be, considering it had all the right pieces to be something great. A movie with an admittedly intriguing idea, never finds its footing and by time it does, the movie is rushing towards its ending. Half baked character’s occupying a half baked world, it feels like after every step forward, the movie takes two major steps back.Pugh continues to be a massive star and her descent into madness is why…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  The center of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”—the sequel to the hugely popular “Black Panther,” and a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman—is sincere, even if the overall film feels manufactured. It begins with a funeral for the recently deceased King T'Challa.

Who does he think he is? Pennywise?HALLOWEEN RANKED  
Pearl 2022;6; Pearl is a crazy fucking bitch 
Nope 2022;10; this movie does for cloud spotting what jaws did for swimming 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;8; As a YA fantasy, this slayed. This was so much fun. Dazzling visuals. The fashion. A killer soundtrack. Great characters. Charlize Theron was a pleasure to watch in such a light role. It’s a shame Cate Blanchett was only the narrator. Her voice was so soothing. Didn’t even mind that it was two and a half hours long. 
How to Blow Up a Pipeline 2022;10;  the ocean’s eleven influence is there but goldhaber citing a man escaped as an inspiration is the more palpable reference. there’s the way it uses its own title to build tension, sure, but i walked away more impressed by the bressonian influence in not having one misstep in the edit and the cinematography being so simple and intentional that it makes it look easy. somehow minimalist and extreme at the same time. just lights a fire under your ass by the end…  
My Policeman 2022;6; let’s talk about david dawson 
Causeway 2022;8; a quietly powerful, deeply human slice of cinema. simply yet lovingly told and beautifuly shot, it sure does feel good to have jennifer back. really needed this today 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; personally i think every film should aspire to be this horny and gay 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; this is just what moderating a discord server is like.full discussion on my podcast SLEAZOIDS. 
My Policeman 2022;6; there’s a part where harry styles’ character is talking about a drawing of himself and he says “i guess it’s easy to draw ordinary looking people” and ppl in the theatre started laughing (because he’s really hot) 
Smile 2022;6; Shit Follows 
Pearl 2022;8; X has the best sex scene of 2022, this has the best end credits. 
Barbarian 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   80So fucking fun. That's my experience now having seen this little killer of a horror film twice in the span of one weekend. Let's start with the structure, which nimbly avoids any drawn-out speechifying and eagerly adjusts the audience's expectations throughout. The first act, leading up to the reveal of the motherly surprise in the basement catacombs, is based on a mix of the traditions of domestic thrillers and other modern films like Don't Breathe, Hush etc. The surface…   
Uncut Gems 2019;10; 100"Come on! KG. This is no different than that. This is me. All right? I'm not a fuckin' athlete, this is *my* fuckin' way. This is how *I* win. All right?" Howard sexting Julia while hiding in the apartment closet - top five funniest scenes of the decade. 
Causeway 2022;8;  Slow and precise. Contemplative instead of demanding. When you read the synopsis or blurb associated with this movie it’s easy to assume you know what kinda movie this is. You don’t. It’s not really like most other oscar bait movies about veterans or related to the military. It’s a quaint little character study. It gives you these peculiar interactions and then later colors them with context through dialogue. I was really surprised by how well written this was and the…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; was it really necessary for harry styles to tap dance for so long 
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;8; easily one of the top 5 movies about taxes 
Rocky III 1982;6; “So, Sly, what’s your big idea for the third Rocky movie?”“Well I was thinking in this one…”[Stallone leans back in his chair and takes a drag of a cigarette]“…Rocky fights a really mean guy.” 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; Halloween Ends makes Halloween Kills look like Carpenter’s Halloween. 
Black Adam 2022;4; There are 3 Dwayne Johnson jumpscares in this film 
Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story 2022;8; i just know Evan Peters' therapist is a millionaire 
My Policeman 2022;8; marion should’ve known tom was gay he’s from brighton 
Smile 2022;6; last 10 minutes had no right being that good when the rest of the film was so shit 
20th Century Girl 2022;8; next time netflix releases a kdrama/kmovie set in the late 90s i'm just going to have my therapist on standby 
Hocus Pocus 1993;8; when i first watched this film as a kid, i asked my dad what a virgin was and he told me it was a person from virginia 
Amsterdam 2022;2; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I’m sorry, Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Cause she’s dead.  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  ¿Recuerdan cuando Chris Nolan no quería hacer una tercera entrega de la trilogía de The Dark Knight porque su idea incluía a Heath Ledger pero de todos modos lo hizo para cumplir con su contrato? Así se siente Wakanda Forever, pero sin la emoción de The Dark Knight Rises.Wanda Forever tiene dos películas: Shuri superando la muerte de T’Challa y su camino a convertiste en Black Panther, y la relación de Namor con Wakanda. Ambas siento yo son ideas…  
My Policeman 2022;6; Meh Policeman 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Yes woman, yes cry 
Terrifier 2016;2; Imma keep it real with u chiefI’m tired of torture porn 
Pearl 2022;8; Damn I need me a freak like that!!!!!!! 💯 😫🤤‼️Pt. 2 
Halloween Ends 2022;6; they very obviously had no idea where to go with these and somehow accidentally wound up with bozo mode christine/last temptation of myers. hilarious and probably not good but i kinda liked it anyway, and if you're into halloween 4 or 6 at all this is probably the one you've been waiting for. corey fever is sweeping the nation.full discussion on my podcast SLEAZOIDS. 
My Policeman 2022;6; every one of patrick’s diary entries is justJuly 7th, 1958Had gay thoughts again today 
The Watcher 2022;2; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  you're seriously telling me that i just watched 7 episodes in 1 afternoon for you to just conclude that the case is unsolved???? go to hell all of you  
Black Adam 2022;4; CGI skinny Chris Evans walked so CGI skinny Dwayne Johnson could plummet into the cold abyss 
Bros 2022;8; I’m gay. Like this review if you like that I’m gay.#LikeIfYouLikeThatImGay 
The Suicide Squad 2021;8; So cool that the entire thing builds to the simple but profound idea of petting the rat, not saving the cat. 
Black Adam 2022;4;  With his epic physique and intense glare, Dwayne Johnson certainly looks like a superhero. But these days most movie stars get into ridiculous physical shape for these sorts of parts. Big muscles don‘t make you special onscreen anymore. And in general, Black Adam is a very familiar (if slightly more graphic) superhero movie — at least through its first and second acts. Then, after more than an hour without a clear villain, a Big Bad finally appears to menace the…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; started off very strong with a respectful and emotional opening sequence which automatically set the tone for the entire film. this shit was 160 minutes and I didn’t even notice it that much. more storytelling in here than action sequences which I was totally fucked with. one of the slower films in the MCU and a beautiful finale for phase four. 
Decision to Leave 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  nooo don't kill yourself you're so sexy aha  
Aftersun 2022;10; made me want to kill myself, a high mark of any movie 
The Shining 1980;10;  shelley duvall's performance in this film is one of the most intense and realistic portrayals of fear and terror i've ever seen and her skilled acting brought me to tears.the fact that shelley duvall is constantly overlooked when ever i see anyone talk about this film is a fucking crime, especially considering the mental and emotional abuse kubrick caused her so she could maintain a realistic performance and critics didn't even mention her once upon this film's release, it's…  
Lake Mungo 2008;8;  A rather pleasant surprise here. Mock documentary style film-making in horror is something I can't say I've seen before. Lake Mungo is incredibly well-acted and does an exceptional job at building a somber and haunting atmosphere. The setting is uneasy and this movie manages to make my stomach turn with its overly-realistic execution and sense of realism. The screenplay is brilliant. A mock documentary film should not be this good at keeping me invested and fully involved with this family's…  
See How They Run 2022;8; This movie just spawned out of nowhere but it was very enjoyable 
Falling for Christmas 2022;8; get in loser, the lindsay lohan film renaissance is here! 
Dirtbag 2022;8; Obviously has some of the first-film awkwardness and chops, but overall I really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere of the project. And kind of has a sweet theme about how the baggage we receive in life doesn’t necessarily leave, but rather transforms and grows alongside us.Yeah man. Way to go Runquist. You’re a whore for blocking me on Letterboxd but I dig your filmmaking skills 
Pearl 2022;8; Pearl is not a horror movie in the same way X is a horror movie, but it’s also why it works as the perfect companion to X. It opts completely out of the slasher genre, substituting the blood and sex infused depravity of X (there’s still some interesting moments in Pearl) with a full blown character study of Pearl. While this will certainly be a disappointment for those looking for kills and thrills, Mia Goth makes up for it by simply being Mia Goth.Dragged a little too much for my liking, but the last 30 minutes is Mia Goth proving she’s a fucking superstar. 
My Policeman 2022;4; i’ve watched gay porn with a more engaging plot 
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  Love it or hate it, Terrifier 2 definitely pushes boundaries.There is plenty to admire here for the gore aficionados but more isn’t necessarily better.  With the addition of a story that is far from good, anytime Art isn’t on the screen it comes to a screeching halt.  A few cuts and trims bringing it in at the 1hr 30m mark would have made it less of a slog.  Kudos to Damien Leone for the practical effects work.  He managed to pull…  
Barbarian 2022;10; The Descent 3: How I Met Your Mother 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; nightmare blunt rotation is just olivia wilde and alex garland in 2022 
Spider-Man 2002;10; Pop Culture Opera. A beautiful melodrama full of iconic imagery and sincerity. The true trendsetter, the ultimate origin. Beautiful shit dude. 
Twilight 2008;8; Imagine hating Twilight. 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; This was ASS and a massive disrespect to the characters of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. 1.5 stars strictly because some of the kills were brutal and the first death of the movie genuinely caught me off guard. 
X 2022;10; Much like M. Night Shyamalan and Ari Aster, Ti West succeeds at horror because he understands that there’s nothing scarier than naked old people 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; to everyone who's planning to see this: bring tissues and only wear waterproof makeup. thank me later 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; I think it's nice and fun that the Talokans greet each other by holding their hands open like a lil shell 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;4;  That catwalk scene with you should see me in a crown playing was so funny 😂 how did they not cut it out of the film.And there was a random Olivia Rodrigo song played when Sofia Wylie’s character was on screen that felt very META 😅 This film reminds me of all those Disney channel tv movies I used to watch and love when I was younger that when I revisit them when I’m older, I realize they weren’t…  
BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;10;  Venecia, el mismo festival que le dio leoncillo a Nuevo Orden, fue donde acribillaron esta película. Ya dije mucho.Nuevamente chavos recuerden que “Separar el arte del artista” es una mamada, esta película es la prueba de ello. Bardo, Falsa crónica de unas cuantas verdades es una lluvia intensa de ideas, emociones, metáforas y pensamientos que van ligadas desde la vida de una persona que lo ve desde su edad, profesión, nacionalidad, privilegio, etc. Así como lo es cualquier búsqueda…  
Aftersun 2022;10;  You never really shake that feeling of seeing darkness in your parents that you don’t understand yet. The sudden realization that holes are being poked in your perfect image of them, and you don’t know whether to resent them or pity them or all of the above. I don’t like to get very personal with reviews but it’s hard to separate my thoughts on Aftersun from my own experiences, and it’s worth mentioning that I’ve probably never felt so acutely…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; henry cavill as sherlock holmes can be my daddy anytime he wants 
TÁR 2022;10;  To give a hint at what's special about TÁR you needn't look further than the opening credits. The opening credits start backwards with members of the crew that generally are at the very end of the end credits, like catering and production units and assistant editors. This is a movie about how an ego can grow too big and turn to manipulation when one role gets too much credit in a collaborative field. An orchestra is like a film set,…  
TÁR 2022;8;  First new movie I’ve seen in a while that I wanted to immediately rewatch. There are so many details that are ambiguous on first viewing that I’m sure take on additional heft once you understand what the film is about. If my theater had another showing after the one I attended, I might have gone right back in for Round 2.One touch that really resonated with me after the movie was over was Todd Field’s choice to begin his…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6; Laurie really said "call an ambulance, call an ambulance!!! but not for me..😈" 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8; does so much for people with a podcast 
Halloween Ends 2022;2; Absolutely fucking not.The writers have clearly never interacted with anybody in Marching Band. 
Aftersun 2022;10; watched this for the… 6th(?) time today. hurts so good. an all-timer. few fiction movies, if any, have better harnessed the inherently haunted power of old home video footage. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tries assiduously to make this work without the sorely missed Chadwick Boseman and it prevails somewhat.There are some mighty big shoes to be filled here and Letitia Wright isn’t up for the task.  Luckily, everyone else in the cast is.  Angela Bassett once again delvers another outstanding performance proving that she should have won that Oscar for “What’s Love Got to Do with It.”  The big surprise is Tenoch Huerta as Namor.  His execution of…  
Bros 2022;8; I desperately need Home Alone but with Sarah Paulson to become a real thing 
The Witch 2015;10; not a cell phone in sight. just people living in the moment. 
Pearl 2022;10; the real female joker 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; One of the dumbest movies I’ve seen in a long time and I mean that as the highest complement. 
Blair Witch 2016;10; “once upon a time, i thought it was a documentary, so i asked beebaw (grandpa) if it was a documentary, and he said yes, and i got really scared, but at the end of the movie he said it wasn’t a documentary 😡”(her phone starts ringing)and then what happened?“and then i’m done”(she walks away to take a call) 
X 2022;8; The Texas Backshot Massacre 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; I don’t like long horror films. I don’t like clown horror films. I didn’t like Terrifier. But goddamn if I didn’t just have the best gore filled, F’d up, crowd groaning, gut churning, HFS they went there & MORE screening of this.  It’s been a while since a film shocked me in this way but I was smiling like a weirdo the whole time. A true gore classic for the Halloween season! 
Barbarian 2022;8; me at the start of the movie, excited to watch a fun new horror film before halloween: 😃me at the end of the movie, absolutely devoid of all happiness and scared to use the bathroom: 😀 
Get Out 2017;10; my favorite commentary that I've read about this movie was from Rian Johnson who said "I love that if the movie Get Out existed in the world of Get Out, the parents would have told Chris how much they loved Get Out" 
Grimcutty 2022;2; GRIMCUTTY IS GRIMCUMMIN! WATCH OUT FOR ITS GRIMBUSSY!! 
Scream 1996;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Billy rlly said “you’ve been acting like such a bitch since ur mom died :/“  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; This is my favourite film of the year so far, i’m sure to be in the minority here. This is one of those films that just had this profound impact on me throughout. From the many laughs, perfect dialogue and incredible setting to the heartbreaking moments and brutal honesty. It’s deceptively simple and raw, but one that will stay with you for a long while.FULL REVIEW HERE 
Argentina, 1985 2022;10;  - Facho- Y este?- Súper facho.- Ah este puede ser... na no dije nada, re contra facho.Que felicidad ver tanta gente en el cine para ver algo nacional.Está todo bien hecho, no falla nadie ni nada, tiene hasta sus momentos cómicos para ponerle un freno a tanto drama y que no te vayas en lagrimas. Tiene dos escenas que te rompen el pecho. Darín es un maestro y no hay nada que se diga de…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Here’s a sentence I never expected to write: The most romantic movie of the year (so far) is a police procedural. Then again, I wasn’t aware that “Oldboy” director Park Chan-wook — whose operatic revenge melodramas have given way to a series of ravishingly baroque Hitchcockian love stories about the various “perversities” that might bind two wayward souls together — was making a detective thriller. In that case, the heart-stirring potential of the Korean auteur’s new detective saga would have…   
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Gorgeous, but very messy. Jordan Peele is the cutest stop-motion character in history. 
Pearl 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i know she did not just tongue that scarecrow  
Scream 1996;8; with all that horror movie knowledge, lets count ourselves lucky stu and billy didnt turn into the next worse thing: student filmmakers 
Fight Club 1999;10; i love fight club but i hate people who love fight club 
Nope 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  this is my ‘don’t look up’  
Barbarian 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  so cute when mother goes *boop*  
Ticket to Paradise 2022;2; Technically meets the criteria to be called a movie. 
The Whale 2022;6; I watched for Brendan 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;8; we, as a society, need to protect selena gomez at all costs 
Armageddon Time 2022;8;  70I do think it's fair to say that James Gray overreaches a tad with this one, mostly in the intersection between race and class. There's just not enough nuance to Johnny's character depiction to fully contextualize Paul's guilt and privilege as a moral center. The short glimpses of what we do see of Johnny's living conditions doesn't quite live up to the detail of Paul's family struggle. This makes sense, as it is just as much a story of…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is blockbuster filmmaking on another level. It surpasses the incredible first film with high stakes and and thrilling world-building.The entire ensemble is phenomenal, but Tenoch Huerta bursts onto the scene with a brilliant, complex turn as Namor.The cinematography, score, visual effects - everything is even better than before. Some of the best crafts in any Marvel film. A breath of fresh air all around.It’s an emotional, dark journey, leading to a full-scale war, but always feels personal. This may be the best Marvel movie yet. 
Hocus Pocus 1993;8; why did everyone bully this child SO hard for being a virgin leave him alone he’s like 15 😭😭 
The Fabelmans 2022;10; paul dano and michelle williams are the mom & dad duo we all need but don’t deserve 
Inglourious Basterds 2009;8;  <ENGLISH VERSION BELOW>Wenn Tarantino die Regie übernimmt, greift ein Klischee. Die Zielgruppe aufgeteilt in zwei Positionen, deckungsgleich mit der derzeitigen Herangehensweise zahlreicher Regisseure und dem Muster treubleibend. Dabei zeugt bei ersterer weder die Prämisse, oder Ausführung des reinen Erzeugnisses von Relevanz, sondern in höherem Maße die Erfahrung mit den Protagonisten, oder Stilmitteln vergangener Werke. Sei es das entkrampfte Auftreten, oder aber erbarmungslose Action: Die Figuren und die Brutalität in den vorherigen Werken des Regisseurs, schließen auf eine ähnliche Formel…  
Halloween 1978;8; all this guy does is stand there breathing heavily like damn bitch just take a puff from your inhaler and go 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;6; Paul Feig looked at both Cinderella & The Harry Potter films and said I'm gonna combine them both and make the blandest thing imaginable 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, though perhaps not technically the best and arguably not the most famous movie in an extremely specific genre of films, it’s an exceptionally fun watch, incredibly clever, and well worth checking out. The humor is self referential, simultaneously self reverential and self deprecating, and managed to subvert my expectations at every turn. Throw everything you thought you knew about the late, great, devil’s squeeze box player and enjoy this ridiculous ride. 2022 RankedCredit to @Lileccy for the Bacon NumberDegrees of Kevin Bacon: 11. Toby Huss and Kevin Bacon In R.I.P.D. 
Elvis 2022;6;  wish i was convinced as others seem to be that this is meaningfully interrogating the glitzy “greatest show on earth” carnival mythmaking it’s trafficking in—or that putting the exact same corny biopic beats we get every year in vulgar formal dress-up is inherently interesting/radical. but i have to give credit to baz on this one that i’d rather these kinds of movies stop shooting for faux historical authenticity and just blatantly lie to me and make me confused about where…  
Confess, Fletch 2022;6; takes what feels like in terms of plot trajectory should be a dark paperback neo-noir, and channels it through some charmingly light and sincere screwball/caper energy. really respect that this has pretty minor, lowkey aspirations but it successfully hits them all in a way that feels consistently effortless. there are so many wonderful supporting performances with just enough goofy personality that i never got tired of seeing hamm react to them with funny faces and bursts of wit and wordplay. he’s clearly having a blast and i loved his stan smith, lakers hat and suit drip. would absolutely watch more of these. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Wakanda Forever packs an emotional punch.  Themes of grief and loss in the wake of T’challa’s death run throughout the film, but they are inextricably tied to the real-life untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. As such the film serves as a moving tribute to the late actor, and features some truly heart-rending moments. Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright give powerful performances with accompanying lush visuals and propulsive score from Ludwig Göransson—my favorite working composer in the business right now. The film isn’t without some of…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Damn girl just split the bill… 
Nope 2022;8; Um if it's so hard to get footage of this thing then how did the cameraman of the movie get footage of it so often 🤔🤔🤔 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  Is it better to be remembered or liked? It’s a question with little more practical utility for the majority of people than, say, trying to play a fiddle with four fingers. The idea nonetheless becomes the preoccupation of one of the characters of Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin,” played by Brendan Gleeson. One day, after pondering the dilemma, he decides that he will abruptly cut off friendship with his best mate, former “In Bruges” partner, Colin Farrell, and choose…  
Barbarian 2022;8; Hahahahahahaha oh jesus damn wow what a ride 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; at least jason sudeikis created ted lasso out of their divorce’s trauma 
Scream 1996;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i already knew billy was gonna be the killer because i have seen so many fifteen year old girls on tumblr nutting over pics of him covered in blood but i did not suspect shaggy from scooby doo for one god damn second consider me SHOOK  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  🏆96%2022 list - Click HEREYouTube video review - Click HEREThe story follows teenagers Paul Bäumer and his friends Albert and Müller, who voluntarily enlist in the German army, riding a wave of patriotic fervor that quickly dissipates once they face the brutal realities of life on the front. Paul's preconceptions about the enemy and the rights and wrongs of the conflict soon crumble.There are a few genres that occasionally hit me harder than others. I can normally find…  
Get Out 2017;10; Get Out is a horror film that deconstructs the genre by demystifying its conventional rules. It begins with a typical plot in which an unsuspecting protagonist becomes entangled in a frightening situation, but then it deviates into uncharted territory. This movie contains many twists and turns intended to shock and surprise viewers. The narrative's unpredictability is what makes it exciting for audiences 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Corey in the house 
Barbarian 2022;8; doesn’t quite reach the level that malignant is on, but did more for me than X (and a certain related prequel). personally i cannot get enough of these silly billy nightmare movies 
Get Out 2017;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  aggressively straight white boy into sports? killed in wrestling match. white dad who said he loves when deer die? impaled by antlers. evil psychiatrist mom? killed in her office. psycho girlfriend who earlier pretended to care that chris felt responsible for his moms hit and run? left to die by the side of the road. THATS called poetry motherfuckers  
Black Adam 2022;6; The Rock changed the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe. The mad man actually did it. 
Terrifier 2 2022;10; yoo the slasher genre is ALIVE 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;6; the most unrealistic thing about this movie is sofia wylie being called ugly 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; yes i do the cooking yes i do the cleaning yes i keep the nana real sweet for your eating 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; The naked truth is that Weird: The Al Yankovic Story seems destined for a fate like Leslie Nielsen’s autobiography or Al’s own UHF: As a cult object beloved by a few for the sheer oddness of its perspective and sense of humor. (The final title card alone makes it something of a minor triumph.) Weird won’t make anyone forget Walk Hard, but it might make some folks go and break out their old Weird Al records and give them a spin for the first time in a while. (I recommend Dare to Be Stupid.)Full review at ScreenCrush. 
My Policeman 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It’s certainly interesting watching this in a room full of mostly old straight people. Where I was sobbing, I looked over and watched a man yawn and heard another laugh at a somber moment. I think this was my first experience watching a queer love story in a cinema and I was taken aback by the apathy in the room. Nevertheless, I was truly moved by the film and it’s portrayal of love, loss, and the complexities of the queer…   
Pearl 2022;8; MIA GOTH MIA GOTH MIA GOTH MIA GOTH 
Midsommar 2019;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Imagine being left out of your family's suicide lmao  
Pearl 2022;8; mia goth outsold timothée chalamet in cmbyn during the end credits 
Black Adam 2022;6; They should have made The Rock sing You're Welcome at the end, and perhaps that would have solved the film's entire problem. What a waste! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  “TChalla is dead, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone.”-Ramonda-Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a welcomed deviation from the recent slog of cookie-cutter Marvel fare. Yes, it’s true. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever sports best in class, top-tier visuals and indulgent action sequences…BUT…The real victor comes via the shockingly heartfelt story that encompasses and honors everything Boseman and Black Panther built. So yeah, “TChalla is dead, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone.” as a matter of fact, his spirit has…  
Donnie Darko 2001;10; me: this is a masterpiecealso me: has to google "what is donnie darko about" 
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;8; all rise for the anti-facist pinocchio 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10; feel very connected to her, lots of peace and love 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;8; Gemma Chan said “stupid stupid man” and the whole room applauded.That’s it. 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10; pretty people should never cry 
Halloween Kills 2021;2; above all else this is an inaccurate portrayal of small town illinois as there were no scenes of the townspeople standing on their lawns, gossiping with their neighbors and trying to get a glimpse of michael walking around like he was a twister during a tornado warning 
Suspiria 2018;10; me and my girlies playing just dance on the wii 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; the reason why brad and janet’s relationship didn’t work is because they’re both bottoms 
Entergalactic 2022;6; i swear to god he’s literally a lonely stoner who tries to free his mind at night 
The Batman 2022;8; I just love how fucking disgusting Bruce looks in this. Nasty ass stringy ass translucently pale goth boy in his dank disgusting batcave hunched over his computer with bloodshot eyes and black eye paint scrolling through footage of the previous night and journaling his fucked up thoughts. When he finally emerges from the cave to talk to Alfred and gets disturbed by the natural sunlight and has to put on sunglasses I wanted to get up and cheer. Yeah that’s right put on those sunglasses you little freak. Also he’s definitely a virgin based on how he composes himself around Catwoman. Fucking fantastic movie 
X 2022;8; old people scare me too 
TÁR 2022;8; "You could use an adjustment. You're somewhat crooked." 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; rarely has there been a gap so enormous between how smart a movie thinks it is and how smart it actually is. we need to do something to stop Harry Styles’ acting career and we need to do it quick 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  in terms of directorial voice and style, this is easily the most tactile, soulful, and human MCU movie since Black Panther. it's just that the storytelling sometimes feels clunky and pasted together. I wanted to feel more invested than I was...but it's a little messy. one of the things I appreciate most about Wakanda Forever is that despite the movies (and tragedies) in between, it does feel like a direct continuation of Coogler's first Black Panther movie and the characters,…

Bullet Train 2022;8; who allowed aaron taylor johnson to be this hot 
My Policeman 2022;6;  if there was one phrase that could describe this movie it would be by the numbers. It doesn’t really try to subvert any expectations you may have for a movie about a queer guy in Britain falling in love with a man while publicly being with a woman. It does nearly everything you’d expect. The characters are pretty thin only existing for their parts in the affair and it’s inevitable downfall. It often made me question the need for its…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Zur Videokritik: youtu.be/fYzUd9whFj4Kann man Marvel verübeln, dass sie diese Fortsetzung so machen wollten? Kein Neustart, kein Recast, stattdessen erzählt man um Chadwick Bosemans Tod herum und zollt ihm so nachträglich Tribut. Das muss man schon irgendwie respektieren, auch wenn diese Entscheidung für den Film leider die falsche war.„Wakanda Forever“ nimmt also Abschied, führt einen neuen Black Panther ein, führt noch den obligatorischen Fremdcharakter ein, der nur anwesend ist, weil man sich dann die Promo für die anstehende Disney+…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  T'Challa may not be physically present in this sequel, but his presence is felt throughout the film until the credits roll.It felt so real that you couldn't help but cry inside the cinema, making this one of the most emotional Marvel films to date. The loss of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther himself, in a tragic and shocking death made the task Coogler and Marvel faced all the more challenging. This was a real-life loss of this magnitude that…  
John Wick 2014;10; a very foundational text for me. watching this was a gateway that led me to checking out stuff like point blank, the driver, ghost dog, basically every john woo film, michael mann, jean-pierre melville, johnnie to, paul schrader, the noir genre in general, basically every 'stoic lone professional with a code of honor and a dangerous job in a myopic underworld' movie that i'm obsessed with, it all starts with this. don't care about all the post-reddit epic bacon keanu shit that's happened since then, i still love this series and you cannot convince me otherwise. 
American Psycho 2000;10; I think he wants to fit in 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; that's it. i'm buying a miniature donkey. 
The Autopsy 2022;10; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities- Episode 3I think I’m in love with The Autopsy, maybe David Prior?This is everything I wanted to be and so much more. Starts off as this detective procedural and evolves into something so much more sinister (very akin to The Empty Man). Deliciously sadistic and while it goes in an almost unfathomable direction, it never loses its evil spirit. Immaculately shot, extraordinarily acted, and the last 15 minutes is pure horror bliss. One of my favorite pieces of horror this year, will be watching annually. 
Causeway 2022;8;  Welcome back Jennifer Lawrence.Not to say she actually went anywhere, she was the ray of light in the painfully abysmal Don’t Look Up, but after a near decade under the intense Hollywood limelight, Causeway is a gentle reminder of her immense talent. However, it is not to be understated that while Lawrence is quietly brilliant, she is made even better when paired with Brian Tyree Henry. Their dynamic, while built on a foundation of trauma, evolves into this beautiful friendship that…  
The Curse of Bridge Hollow 2022;8;  God Letterboxd users take every fucking film so seriously it's actually not even funny anymore. Chill out and have some fun. It's like you actively go out of your way to hate something. If you watched this knowing you wouldn't like it and just wanted to write a review on how much you dislike movies like this, then you're just pathetic (which I bet MOST people on this site do). If you expected more from this beyond what the trailer…  
Decision to Leave 2022;8;  way funnier than i was expecting, in part because it takes its noir femme fatale gf/hitchcockian obsessed man bf dynamic completely emotionally seriously but in order to sustain it on a narrative level has to keep having its characters make increasingly ridiculous decisions. the best part is easily the editing which latches itself subjectively into the intense fixations and headspace of the tormented insomniac at its center and as a result basically moves at the confused, unhinged rapid pace of…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;2; its like black swan, the great gatsby, and us had a baby and the baby sucks 
Fight Club 1999;8; It's a movie about men so obsessed with their masculinity that they start fighting each other. They're like little boys who refuse to grow up 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Not as bad as I was lead to believe. With a little more care and some fat trimmed I think this could've been a really neat movie. As it stands it's a mildly fun ride. Also (hilarious) random plane that goes down and serves no purpose other than to lead the protagonist to the one spot she's not supposed to go??...lmao  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Every afternoon — for as long as anyone on the tiny, fictional Irish isle of Inisherin can remember — two friends have sat together at the only pub in a town for a few pints of Guinness. This shared ritual might be the only thing these men have in common.Pádraic Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell), the younger of the two, is a sweet and simple type who doesn’t ask for much from life, and gives it exactly that in return.

Spider-Man 2002;8; Spider-Man is an exceptional superhero movie that has been enormously successful both commercially and critically. It has impressive visual effects and has garnered widespread acclaim since it is both an engaging introduction to the genre for novices and a captivating experience for young people 
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;10;  What happens, happens. And then we’re gone. TL,DR: Pinocchio is the best animated movie of 2022 and I cried like a baby. The word timeless gets thrown around a lot, especially when it comes to conversations surrounding Pinocchio. This makes sense considering there's seemingly infinite adaptations of the Carlo Collodi tale extending all the way back to its publication in 1883. But while the story clearly has stood the test of time, very little has changed since its 1940 Disney…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; wakanda forever ladies and gentlemen 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  Enola Holmes 2 is a joy! A step up from the first in every aspect with a more settled, competent Millie Bobby Brown leading the way as the titular character alongside an ever brilliant Henry Cavill who is brilliant as Sherlock Holmes. One of my complaints about the first film is how the mystery was lacking, it was predictable and while the cast and humour was great, the story lacked any surprises. This time around, they upped their game and…  
My Policeman 2022;10; the scene where tom softly touches patrick’s neck, making him pause in the middle of his sentence before leaning into it is just so beautiful and makes me hold my breath every single time 
Rosaline 2022;8; the romeo and juliet modern comedic retelling I didn’t know I needed. this was just so fun 
TÁR 2022;10;  “TÁR” is so much more than the Great American Movie about “cancel culture” — a phrase that it humiliates with every movement — but this dense and difficult portrait of a female conductor’s fall from grace also demands to be seen through that singular lens from its very first shot. Todd Field’s thrilling, deceptively austere third film exalts in grabbing the electrified fence of digital-age discourse with both hands and daring us to hold onto it for 158 minutes in…

Before Sunrise 1995;10; I use the train everyday and this never happens 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  I do not know if at this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the films can still be lean. There's always too much to service, too much to set up for later installments. But if a movie must be bloated, it may as well be interesting. And I do think that's what we get here: a sprawling story of war coming to Wakandan shores, filtered through personal grief, and touching on big, anti-colonial themes. In Wakanda, we imagine a nation…  
The Munsters 2022;10;  89It's clear that Rob Zombie made The Munsters for himself, but he might as well have made it for me. The idea of taking a B&W 50s sitcom riff on suburban domesticity and turning it into an kaleidoscopic explosion of color and Transylvanian kitsch may have started as a studio mandate, but the results are delightful and warm and uniquely Rob Zombie. Your mileage may vary in regards to its corniness, but for me, it's a feature, not a…  
Hellraiser 2022;4;  people might not remember at this point but barker’s original film is actually quite cheaply and amateurishly made and accumulates most of its power through sheer uncompromising and ugly imagination for its characters' perverted sexual yearnings and their subsequent sadomasochistic body horror punishments for them, turning a silly familial melodrama into practically a cosmic, erotic fulci movie. this, on the other hand, has opted for the approach of a slick and competent addiction drama as prestige slasher, which if that’s…

The School for Good and Evil 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  early screening - FRIENDS?!?!!? the way that everyone in the audience groaned when she kissed that gaston ass man and cheered when she left him. this was gay. every single character was bisexual.EDIT - just found out they are apparently sisters…i don’t believe it.  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Visiting Wakanda always feels like entering a singular and fully realized place. It always feels immersive and interesting no matter what context its in between the first movie or even Infinity War. Wakanda Forever was no different and perhaps upped the immersive quality of it. This movie is an epic and has a lot to address. I’d heard before watching that people saw it as bloated or overlong. I can’t agree. I don’t really see many scenes that were unneeded…  
Ticket to Paradise 2022;6; come for George Clooney and Julia Roberts, stay for ……… the comedic stylings of Lucas Bravo from Emily in/Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris?!?!?!?! 🤩i know Lucas Bravo sounds like a fake name but i’m pretty sure he’s real and i’m 100% sure he’s going to be a star. watch this space 
TÁR 2022;10;  JUILLIARD STUDENT: I never played The Last of Us. I’d rather spend my free time—and my money—supporting work places that foster fair labor practices.LYDIA TÁR: Oh, yes, I suppose we should sacrifice the mechanical ambitions of Jak X: Combat Racing and the technical prowess of A Thief’s End to the ever-evolving, reckless defenestrations of contemporary culture’s most regressive cultural whims. Great art—like Cortex Strikes Back, or Keef the Thief—requires dedication, young man. Would you want your nascent work to be defined by…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; War never changes and neither do war movies. Still, some are better at depicting the senseless barbarity of war rather than romanticizing it and fortunately, All Quiet on the Western Front falls in the former. Faithful to the novel's famous anti-war message and backed by a powerful score with gripping cinematography, the film is another poignant reminder that there are no winners in war, only victims. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10; This would’ve been so good in theaters. On a technical level, it is fucking OUTSTANDING. I'm literally speechless. Deserves to be nominated in every single major category. Felix Kammerer you are a star and your performance was heartbreakingly beautiful.Possibly the best film of the year so far. 
Amsterdam 2022;4; Can’t believe I missed Bake Off for this 
Do Revenge 2022;8; This whole concept would have worked better in a college environment. 
The Fabelmans 2022;10;  Every movie lover has an origin story, the moment they realized the awesome power and alchemical magic of cinema. The Fabelmans begins with Steven Spielberg’s. Steven — Sammy in the film — is taken by his parents on his first trip to the movie theater, where they watch Cecil B. DeMille’s The Greatest Show on Earth. A nervous Sammy watches in horror, then mouth-agape fascination, as a pair of circus trains collide. To 2022 adult eyes, the crash effects are…

You’d never see him again and you’d talk about it for the next 20 years 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS. WHAT A PICTURE. THIS is why i go to the movies!!!!! i would not be at all mad if harris dickinson and dolly de leon go home with an oscar for what they delivered here. WOW 
The Woman King 2022;2;  So like, nobody did any sort of research before picking a topic to make a #girlboss movie? Here's some snippets from the most laziest form of research imaginable:"The growth of Dahomey coincided with the growth of the Atlantic slave trade, and it became known to Europeans as a major supplier of slaves. As a highly militaristic kingdom constantly organised for warfare, it captured children, women, and men during wars and raids against neighboring societies, and sold them into the…

12 Angry Men 1957;10; I've never had Jury duty but I'm pretty sure this sets up a completely unrealistic standard for how exciting it would be. 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; she was indeed a good nurse 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4; Why did martin freeman have almost the same amount of screen time as michaela coel 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;6; The best scenes are the ones that include Henry Cavill carrying the weight of the scene on his goddamn back. Beyond that, Milly Bobby becomes more so an obnoxious liability than she does a charismatic lead. 
Barbarian 2022;10;  Of course this will be a biased review. I’m  practically brothers with the guy who wrote and directed it. That being said…I read the script for this movie about a year and a half ago.  I read it in one sitting, halfway-undressed for bed, and I loved it. I found it weird and gross and a very well-told story. I was absolutely thrilled tonight to see that the script made it to the screen with barely a word changed.…  
Nightcrawler 2014;8; Jake Gyllenhaal gives a horrifying performance as a freelance news reporter who films accidents and crime scenes. He's like a paparazzo on steroids, only preying on other people's misfortunes. The film comes across as convincing and believable, yet you start to wonder why someone would want to profit from the suffering of others

Joker 2019;10; Let's agree that Joker is the modern-day version of Taxi Driver. It's like Travis Bickle, but instead of a cab driver and Robert De Niro, we have a clown and Joaquin Phoenix. But the premise is pretty much the same: A loner with a gun trying to make sense of the world around him

Amsterdam 2022;6;  The biggest mystery in David O. Russell’s Amsterdam — far bigger than the one surrounding the dead body at the film’s center — is how did a movie with so many stellar elements turn out so mediocre? This movie has an absurd number of A-list stars, a.promising premise, a timely message, maybe our greatest living cinematographer, and a director who has made some excellent movies in the past. And yet even with all those outstanding components, something feels off about…

Nope 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   on the rewatch i noticed daniel kaluuya’s character communicating to people the way one typically communicates w an animal – clicking his tongue, slapping his leg, that sorta thing. he knows animals better than he knows people – what a horse needs in order to feel safe on set, but struggling to communicate that effectively to crew + talent. so when this territorial predator shows up in his backyard, he has the smarts to avoid its gaze, the gut instinct…

Any cogent thought I had evacuated my brain because I was so enamored with the score and aesthetic, but maybe this a testament to the power of Panos. Effortlessly transporting me to the world via sight and sound, yet it never lacks the substance to go with the style. The exposition isn’t heavy handed and it’s paced in a manner that never…

Wendell & Wild 2022;8; The corporate big bads in this movie are just Liz Truss and Black Boris Johnson, and for a number of reasons but mainly that, it deserves Best Animated Feature 
The Stranger 2022;6; was trying to understand why this Netflix movie i was watching for review was so absorbing and well-crafted and then, about 5 minutes before it ended, i realized that it had premiered at Cannes. and that i had commissioned the great Sophie Monks Kaufman to review it, which she had done brilliantly. oh well, watching Sean Harris for 2 hours is never time wasted. and this has been a fascinating insight into my work life thank you.

The Invisible Man 1933;8; Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy, and the Wolfman get all the praise for being the top ghouls on the block, but The Invisible Man killed more people than all of them combined. A gritty, come-to-kill madman, with none of the diva, "all about me", drama from other, flashier monsters.Most of these goofies just wanted a wife. The Invisible Man wanted to do a series of murders and terrorist acts that would bring the world to its knees just for fun. They are NOT the same.

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent 2022;6;  Having heard about this quirky film for so long, I finally got the chance to see and revel in the unbearable weight of the massive talent that is NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKK CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEEEE!!!!And the film delivers on its premise, yet one can't help but feel unsatisfied and as if the premise could have been fleshed out much more. As many have pointed out, everything about the cartel and the CIA side story feels shoehorned and generic. The big reveal at the end…

She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village. But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario - It just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. What's the point of living... if you don't have a dick? 
Werewolf by Night 2022;4; are you guys kidding me with this? has nobody seen an old movie before? they just put a cheap filter over the same style of writing and coverage as usual... it's nice that they did the bare minimum expected of a monster movie and did some of this with costumes/sets/make-up but it still has modern, scope long takes of cg monsters throwing digital doubles around. like cmon 
Smile 2022;6; all those smiling people in the movie were kinda scary 
Se7en 1995;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  KEVIN SPACEY GIVES BRAD PITT HEAD !!! *NO CLICKBAIT*

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is breathtaking. What Coogler has managed to create here, bringing the tragedy of Boseman’s passing to the forefront, celebrating his life and the impact he had on everyone, while also giving us a stunning film, filled with sublime characters and a heart shattering story, is miraculous.  I’m at a loss for words to describe just how sincere this felt. What Coogler has managed to craft here, an emotional, heartfelt blockbuster with a beautiful story of…  
Black Adam 2022;8;  It’s rare that my wife anticipates a films release more than I do—especially when it’s a comic book movie.  But The Rock has come in and upset that hierarchy in our household. Brief spoiler-free thoughts. Loved the JSA. Can see them green-lighting and fast-tracking a standalone JSA film and I would be all for it. Pierce Brosnan is fantastic as Dr. Fate. Honestly just love the sound of his voice, but in addition his character, powerset and overall performance almost…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Quéeee? Una película de Marvel en 2022 que se enfoca en el desarrollo y el sentir de sus protagonistas con cuestiones ideales y existenciales??Al menos eso lo es Wakanda Forever en sus dos primeros actos, los cuáles están manejados con calma emocional y desarrollo de trama bien estructurada. Peeero, mucho de eso se pierde hacía el final cuándo la fórmula Marvel vuelve a tomar control con escenas apresuradas rompiendo los argumentos de sus personajes para llenarlas de efectos visuales…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; namor has to be full of microplastics 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  <ENGLISH VERSION BELOW>In früher Morgenstunde erblüht, erloschen weilt der Funke in Dämmerung. Von Wahrhaftigkeit erkoren, zum Keim der Dunkelheit gelockt. Hoch oben, vorbei am Hindernis zum vermeintlichen Glück, so offen kundig, die triefende Gabelung. Dich hält die dir unsichtbare Kraft und die Bewegung stockt. Der so lang einstudierte Gang, dir die Freiheit zuwerfend, dich hält das Gewissen. "Wie konnte ich nur jene Flagge hissen?"Die Definition einer Suche, welche auf keiner dergleichen Intention beruft, beläuft sich auf einen Kerngedanken,…  
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;10; Watch it and have fun before film Twitter tells you it’s overrated 
Halloween 1978;8; John Carpenter putting the original Thing on a TV in this movie only to make his own Thing a few years later is peak foreshadowing 
The Shining 1980;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I would also be terrified if I saw a vampiric winnie the pooh giving head to someone  
Smile 2022;8; we are now living in a post it follows world, and i am not immune to the movies it inspires. the thread of trauma throughout this is interesting at first but ends up a bit too heavy handed and clunky for my taste, especially near the end. besides that, (and a few lulls in the plot), it kept my attention and has a few choice sequences of absolute terror. i had fun! and that’s most of what i need from a movie like this 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; FULL REVIEW #BlackPantherWakandaForever is a beautiful tribute about Grief & the cycle of violence. Epic in almost all standards but slower in pacing to tell a different kind of story in the MCU. You’ll have tears in your eyes, your heart will sink, and the heart of Chadwick while not there physically is felt throughout the entire movie. Ryan Coogler put his entire heart into this piece of art & even if the film faults in setup for the future of the MCU those small issues disappear so easily after sleeping on it. The most mature MCU film yet 
Decision to Leave 2022;10; more like decision to love 
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  Ok who’s the real psychopath, Art the Clown or Damien Leone for making an over two hour long slasher? Damien Leone went even further into nutso torture porn sadistic territory giving gore hounds plenty to sink their teeth into, clearly the man knows what his audience wants—in a sense, the two hour runtime was a tad much— but he delivers and knows how to make effective and malicious murder set pieces. touching on supernatural overtones and ultra-violent slasher antics, the…

20th Century Girl 2022;10; AND FUCK WOONHO'S DAD I HOPE HE LIVED HIS LIFE FULL OF REGRETS 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Full review coming soon to tiktok but The Banshees of the Inisherin was an absolute delight and sits in my top 10 of the year. Tight, witty, effortless yet impactful script, this film is an interesting exploration of friendship, loss, and family. Colin Farrell is having a wild 2022 and he delivers yet another mesmerizing performance. 
Hocus Pocus 2 2022;8; he/they of the day: the hocus pocus spell book

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; THE MCU IS BACK BABY 
20th Century Girl 2022;8; So heartfelt, so bittersweet. As cheesy and predictable as the typical—classic—storyline about youth & first love, it still has the magical touch that evokes nostalgia of high school first love and the delightful friendship. The kind of story that couldn't hurt any less no matter how predictable it is. My life flashed back to the twenty-five twenty-one trauma all over again. 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;4; I know what you were, what you are! YOU’RE SLIPPIN JENNIFER And Slippin Jennifer I can handle just fine but Slippin Jennifer with a law degree and hulk powers is like a chimp with a machine gun 
Pearl 2022;4;  despite the painfully obvious attempt to turn showbiz fantasy melodrama into psychological horror i would argue this isn't even as dark or heart-wrenching a depiction of dreams being crushed by reality as, idk, the judy garland a star is born. i liked some of the colorful window dressing and mia goth is quite convincing in evil musical theater mode but it was all kinda suffocated for me by the air of emotional gravitas west seems to think this material has…  
Barbarian 2022;10;  When I tell you I was S-W-E-A-T-I-N-G! I went into this as blind as I could. I think I saw one preview and as soon as everyone started saying how good it was I put my blinders up so I really had no idea what I was in for other than “Airbnb gone bad” and it basically went every direction except the one I was expecting it to so I always have to tip my hat to that. I tend…  
Aftersun 2022;10; We as a culture MUST let Paul Mescal dance. 
TÁR 2022;10; So rarely are women allowed to play and vamp onscreen in such thorny, tragic roles. Daniel Day-Lewis, Al Pacino, and F. Murray Abraham have all played men who’ve flown too close to the sun and here, Blanchett says, “my turn.” 
Whiplash 2014;10; i had a dream that j.k. simmons yelled at me and i woke up crying 
The Black Phone 2021;8; “Jesus? What the fuck.” 
The Blob 1988;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I love the way this movie sets up a number of characters like the HS football player, the stern but kindly sheriff and the waitress he asks on a date, who you think are going to be major characters, with their little character beats and romantic aspirations only to do a brutal rug pull, nope sorry they once had hopes, dreams and personalities, but they're blob goo now.  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  That ending 😭This is probably one of the best Netflix original movies which has been released, this had beautiful cinematography and was absolutely devastating to watch as it was such a sad and impactful story. To watch from the Germans perspective is very different to see as you see that from an average soldiers point it’s what they was made to do and especially the ending 15 min to be forced to attack before the cease fire is truly…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;8; went to a special 4-D showing where you can actually feel harry styles spit on you 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; i really thought this was pretty excellent. obviously emotionally heavy but also quite possibly the most entertaining and grand film in the marvel universe. i was actually prepared to give it 5 stars but i do have some gripes with the third act yet none of them seem important in comparison to what i absolutely love about this film. stunning!letitia, angela, danai, tenoch and dominique (can’t wait to see more of her) were standouts but lupita will always have my heart i literally screamed in the theater when she (finally) showed up 
TÁR 2022;10;  Slow, provoking character epics are apparently not dead territory. When Maverick hit earlier this year there was a lot of "they don't make movies like that anymore" lines- this one perhaps makes me feel even more that way but about a different kind of bygone film (it couldn't be more different from Maverick :P). I'm talking about those long movies that slowly chip away at the sculpture of a figure, shaped by an incredible performance echoing off a confident series…  
Lightyear 2022;4; ultimately can't really bring myself to muster much more than a shrug but the fatal flaw here is incredibly obvious: despite the stated premise that this is supposed to be a sci-fi movie a kid in the 90s might've watched and loved there was zero effort made to distinguish this in look/writing from any other modern pixar movie. i get that they can't do the cool version where andy was really into like like stargate or the guyver, but this should at least on some level resemble something like the last starfighter, no? 
Psycho 1960;8; biggest twist of all time is that norman bates is hot 
Falling for Christmas 2022;6; I’m living for this lindsay lohan renaissance 
Pompo the Cinephile 2021;8; Who the fuck livestreams a bank meeting

Terrifier 2016;2;  Ok so i didn't watch this movie again but i keep thinking about it. Like, why is this movie so bad? Isn't it just a normal horror movie doing normal horror things? Aren't they supposed to be upsetting? Aren't they supposed to be scary? Men are bad and do bad violent things. Men dressed as clowns can you expect any more from them in the end? Don't you know what you are getting into when you watch a horror film?…  
House 1977;10; my favorite part about this is that he saw jaws and said “I would like to make a movie like jaws” and then he made this movie

Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Fuera de Serie: That Michael Myers, Looks Like A Kirk To MeIf this film proves anything, it's that high expectations may easily ruin a film and lead to exaggeration. But part of me understands.This film, contrary to popular belief, is conceptually and theoretically coherent with its predecessor (and yes I know this is a new version to the original script). Kills boils down to the idea that terror can transform otherwise normal individuals into violent thugs. This film…

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;4; We had a good thing, you stupid fucking company, We had Tony, we had a plan, we had everything we needed, and it all ran like clockwork! You could have shut your mouth, made content that actually meant something, and made as much money as you ever needed! It was perfect! But no! You just had to blow it up! You, and your one liners and your forgettableness! You just had to be the product! If you’d done your job and known your place, we’d all be happy right now! 
Scream 1996;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Just 2 guys takin turns stabbing each other because they're not gay  
Blade 1998;8;  definitely has some of that over-explained, overlong dumbguy plot nonsense you’d expect of a movie written by goyer but norrington honestly has solid chops and makes them pretty tolerable with his well-calculated combo of silly genre play (inherent to a martial arts vampire hunter that says “motherfucker” a lot)  and brooding mood. the whole thing should feel more unnatural and goofy, and maybe would without the decent steely-blue 90s techno-horror design and snipes, who was seemingly born to play this…  
Elvis 2022;8; This was great. Austin Butler *IS* Elvis in this. His performance is flawless. I loved all the nods to the African American sounds that heavily influenced Elvis. A very nice movie encapseling Elvis' extraordinary life. 
The Black Phone 2021;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  If The Grabber had kidnapped Gwen instead the movie would have been over in like five minutes, she would absolutely demolish him with zero help  
Black Panther 2018;8;  There are so many wonderful actors in this movie. They just never stop showing up in scene after scene. Jordan, Nyong’o. Gurira. Bassett. Kaluuya. Wright. Duke. Whitaker. And, of course, Chadwick Boseman who brought so much humanity and decency to the title character. A Black Panther without him sounds like a mighty tall order. But if any franchise could do pull off a sequel without its star it’s this one, which has so many other wonderful actors ready to step…  
Raw 2016;10; this isn't even a horror movie French people just be like that

Rosaline 2022;8; Too much Romeo, not enough Steve! 
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;10; GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S PINOCCHIO is a remarkable cinematic wonder from a master storyteller. This dark retelling of the relationship between a father & son emotionally resonates deeper than any previous version. David Bradley’s voice performance as Geppetto broke my heart. Superbly crafted with love & care from all departments. A pure, timeless joy to forever cherish.

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  doesn't quite skewer the genre as viciously with its filmmaking as walk hard did and i think the lonely island guys had the right idea with bringing popstar in at a punchy 80 minutes but radcliffe is quite good and i'm happy for al. RIP to a legend, truly ate it too soon. sad it didn't go all the way to the white & nerdy era.  
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On 2021;4; we are hitting alarming levels of nicecore. or maybe i'm dead inside idk but srry, don't get it. i got basically nothing out of the stuff in here that was obviously intended to be moving, and instead found how self-conscious and self-reflexive it was about its own perceived preciousness and wisdom to be incredibly grating.

Pearl 2022;8;  Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Boogie Nights gets traded in for Carrie and Wizard of Oz in an outstanding prequel that only makes X that much better. Pearl isn't just the random homicidal maniac awoken one evening to give X a villain, but rather a terrifying manifestation of someone who was never given a chance at their dream. Who is told that practicality and reality are what society wants, even though it constantly tells you to have a dream. That same…

The Munsters 2022;6;  don't really know what to say to a world that rejects this kind of clear passion for horror even at its most tacky. has great, old school silly-spooky vibes and an infectiously gleeful childishness funneled through a visual sensibility i can only describe as "psychedelic party city commercial." the colors, the wipes, the sets, make-up, etc... it's obvious they spent a ton of money on it but also looks like some friends raided their own closests for costumes and decorations…

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  “Bravo! Bravo! Yes!”-Paul-All Quiet on the Western Front is a sobering WWI epic that dutifully encapsulates the horrors, emotions, and doldrums of war. While tonally bleak and grim, the beauty manages to shine through, delivering one of the most effective and provocative war sagas to date. To that I say: Bravo! Bravo! Yes! What a crowning achievement!Edward Berger has an eye for intimacy. All Quiet on the Western Front by all accounts is touted for its grandiose…

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 1993;10;  the voice of my childhood. nothing will ever be the same now that he’s gone. in my opinion, Kevin Conroy’s performance in this film is the greatest I’ve ever seen in animation. he’s the reason I fell in love with Batman, the way he captured the nuances of both Bruce Wayne and the Caped Crusader enraptured me as a kid and move me as an adult. it feels wrong putting him into past tense. there is a feeling of gratitude…

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  “Yet we all remember the music of the time.” -Colm-The Banshees of Inisherin is a delightfully dark and melancholy film that seamlessly blends its weighty thematic elements through the guise of macabre-esque humor. As the film progresses so does its unsettling and absurd nature, all culminating to an unpredictable and frustratingly perfect ending.Like the music of our time, we remember the greats. Film is the same, and I’m convinced The Banshees of Inisherin will be remembered as one of…

Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  As many critics and people have pointed out that this sequel succeeds where so few others have failed: it improves upon its predecessor. Some of the casting choices and the premise as a whole feel a little clumsy, but I can get past that, and with a stronger writing I can see how it could all work together to produce a really interesting film.Until then, one area where the picture excels is in its use of 4th wall breaking,…

Tenebre 1982;10;  "Tenebrae" is a masterwork done by Italian director and auteur Dario Argento. Filmed and released in the early 80's as Argento had clearly had some established credibility and fandom, this film has an energy of refined effort, a structure build of many years of hard work being perfected leading up to this presentation. This is not a discrediting of other works, as there is extraordinary fandom all over his vast filmography built of different efforts within theme, it is just…  
TÁR 2022;10;  Something I'd been mulling since my first viewing: is Tár actually any good? The person, not the movie. From what we see, she doesn't seem to be a particularly gifted composer, despite her EGOT status. She's regarded as a great conductor, but what does that really mean? When asked to explain why she's more than just a human metronome who's only there to mark time, her answer is basically, "Well, that IS why I'm there, but it's a very important…

Aftersun 2022;10;  A stunning debut that develops with the gradual poignancy of a Polaroid, Charlotte Wells’ “Aftersun” isn’t just an honest movie about the way that we remember the people we’ve lost — fragmented, elusive, nowhere and everywhere all at once — it’s also a heart-stopping act of remembering unto itself. Here, in the span of an oblique but tender story that feels small enough to fit on an instant photo (or squeeze into the LCD screen of an old camcorder), Wells…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Most people are likely to comment on the clunky, lumbering narrative of this movie, especially when it is marred by the trite and muddily rendered action set pieces that have become so heavily encoded in Marvel’s DNA. And yes, this is not wrong, but to me, what work best for Wakanda Forever are the interpersonal storylines, the respect paid to the departed hero, and the world building spectacle, all of which is foregrounded by the tackling of rage and grief that provides some of the most deeply nuanced moments in the MCU that it's hard not to get teary-eyed.

The NeverEnding Story 1984;10;  Well it is pure coincidence but the timing work as I write this the director Wolfgang Petersen passed away. It's the first time I've seen the film after hearing so much about it, and it's almost immediately clear why it has become a classic. The on-screen creativity is remarkable and somewhat nostalgic because it immediately reminded me of the how incredible are the practical effects and puppetry work which has been replaced by CGI, which has been both a blessing…  
My Policeman 2022;8; This one actually broke my heart a little. Well acted. Beautifully filmed. A gorgeous setting. Pleasantly surprised by how decent this was. 
Suspiria 1977;10; the colour red didn’t exist until dario argento invented it in 1977 
Halloweentown 1998;8; can’t stop thinking about the line “look, grandma's going somewhere with the wiener dude” 😭 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  “thanks for watching my dog” “anytime”when the donkey first came inside the house karsten and i turned to eachother and said “im making waffles” in unison  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; girl boss slayed 2 
Barbarian 2022;8; I AM IN SHOCKKK 
The Thing 1982;10; my dog: *looks at me*me: how do i know you're not......... The Thing (1982) 
Barbarian 2022;6;  When Taylor Swift wrote, “Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby,” she was talking about “Barbarian.” Zach Creggar’s so demented that it’s hilarious horror film isn’t quite on the looniness level of last year’s take on the form, “Malignant.” But, it is a welcome - and altogether more thematically cohesive - entry in a genre that has found itself wading a bit too deep lately in the treacherous bog of prestige. That isn’t to say that “Barbarian” entirely…  
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; Words cannot describe how fucking euphoric I feel when Tim Curry steps off that goddamn elevator. 
Possession 1981;10; the scariest part was the fact that they named their child bob 
Lot 36 2022;6; It’s hard not to be excited about a horror anthology curated by the great Guillermo del Toro, though by its very nature I imagine the quality will vary. Lot 36 is not the most auspicious start, failing to make the most out of its limited runtime. Tim Blake Nelson is effective as the bitter, bigoted Nick Appleton, and we are eventually treated to some creatively designed but not well polished monster effects. Unfortunately, the film just doesn’t muster up enough intrigue or suspense to justify spending time with such an unlikeable protagonist. 
Freaky Friday 2003;10; now that’s what i call classic cinema baby 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; Now this was a depressing and dark movie. It really shows how pointless war is in general. The horror of it all. Really well made and beautifully shot. It was very slow and drawn out in moments but that seemed to be intentional. I don’t know if I’d ever watch it again but I appreciate it for what it is and the message it conveys. 
X 2022;8; patrick bateman's videotapes 
Last Night in Soho 2021;8; anya taylor-joy is the girl of your dreams? mine too bitch you’re not special

Blonde 2022;2; This is a Marilyn’s personal hell: where she dies and people keep making movies, documentaries and books about the worst moments of her life over and over again for decades – and we just live in it. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; harry styles graduated summa cum laude from the tommy wiseau school of acting 
Blonde 2022;4; i don’t know how i arrived at this but i’m blaming sam levinson 
The Outside 2022;8; "Men can be fat and hairy and ugly and impolite and old, and nobody cares."Men (derogatory) are going to rate this two stars or lower. 
Raw 2016;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   second watch and it only got better, this might be the best movie I've ever seen. I was asked why I liked it so much and I thought about it to find that I loved how multifunctional this plot was, with many interpretations to be had, from commentaries on animal rights and the meat industry, it also has so much to say about familial relationships, and generational trauma, and possibly even hereditary diseases. HOLD ON. I know that was A…   
Stutz 2022;6;  I’m a writer. When my dad died, I seized on writing a eulogy as my best chance to process his loss — potentially messy and egoistic as it was, I could either make a florid spectacle of my grief or risk letting it fester inside me even worse than it was always going to. Jonah Hill is a filmmaker (among other things), and when his older brother Jordan suffered a fatal embolism in December of 2017, I suspect that Hill…  
Compañeros 1970;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciOk, but why all the sudden I am getting this déjà vu?From the cast to the plot, it's tough to dispute that Corbucci and his writing team, as well as his actors, for whatever reason opted to rehash much of the plot of The Mercenary, but instead of a Polish, Nero is now a Swede, and Milan now plays our Mexican revolutionary with whom Nero's Yodlaf joins forces.…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Tenía mucha expectativa con esta película, sabía que si lograba desarrollar bien su propia historia y tener una esencia que la diferencie de las demás me terminaría gustando, y así fue.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever es sin duda la mejor película de la fase 4 y una de las mejores del MCU en general. Personalmente siento que no supera a la primera entrega pero por muy poco, ya que esta película no tiene nada que envidiar de otras.Definitivamente cuando…  
Flashdance 1983;6; Makes a strong case that most movies should be 70% pop music montages and dance sequences and shot entirely with the characters in silhouette surrounded by smoke 
Halloween Ends 2022;2; Such a smart move for the grand finale of this new Halloween triptych to turn the spotlight on the franchise’s most iconic and beloved character: Corey! 
Scream 1996;10; So apparently Wes Craven had initially turned down directing Scream. He only changed his mind after he was confronted by a 10 year old boy who accused Craven of "going soft" and "having more guts back in the day" when he was directing films like Last House on the Left.All I wanna know is who the fuck was this child that was familiar enough with Wes Craven's filmography to determine that he had been going soft, and how much did his goddamn therapy cost. 
Black Adam 2022;6; BLACK ADAM initially struggles to find its footing but once the Justice Society enters the story it becomes more fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson’s anti-hero presents an intriguing new dynamic to the DCEU, one which I hope will be explored more than it was here as the film can be too busy at times. Solid visual effects. Weak villain. Post-credits scene got the biggest reaction of all. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; harry styles’ performance on icarly was much better in my opinion 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Rich people kinda in their flop era 
Terrifier 2 2022;6;  leone demonstrates a pretty obvious improvement over the first film at weaving his gruesomely juvenile jokes/gore and admirably low-rent aesthetic ugliness into an actual movie structure that feels like its building/progressing beyond its clear goopy sfx demo reel origins and into something that at times has an actual charming, chintzy halloween synth slasher bloodbath mood to it. i especially like the diversity and scale of the cheap, filthy carnival-esque sets and the ambitious inclusion of weird in-universe dreams/music. i do however…  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;6; raquelle reminds me of that dumb bitch from love is blind who gave her dog wine 
American Psycho 2000;8; omg can’t believe Patrick Bateman invented morning routines, the beauty guru jumped out 
Scream 1996;8; i relate to randy because i too scream at everybody about the rules of cinema when it is not appropriate, or asked for, at social events 
The Blair Witch Project 1999;4; With how annoying these characters were, I was rooting for the witch 
Prey for the Devil 2022;4; That last shot of her dramatically grabbing the cross and holding it up to the screen…always leave them laughing I guess 
Halloween Ends 2022;2;  My dad always tells me that whenever I watch a bad movie I get visibly mad, nothing I do or say, he just notices it.The moment I walked into my house after watching Halloween Ends at the theatre, he said I looked angry.Actually, I am extremely furious.It had been a long time since I’ve felt so frustrated, disappointed and infuriated by a movie. And I can’t even believe that maybe just maybe Resurrection isn’t the worst installment in…  
Halloween 2018;8; “i’m sorry i cant do this😭….gotcha” that alone was a reason to give this four stars. even thought i’m watching this out of order im having a fun time. 
One Piece Film Red 2022;10; Joker for fatherless women 
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Terrific stop-motion work, as expected, but Henry Selick and Jordan Peele writing this together, in hindsight, apparently wasn't that great of an idea.I'm all for tackling dark and heavy themes like children's grief and trauma in animated films (Selick) and shutting down the prison-industrial complex (Peele), and as much as this is PG-13, I'm not sure how or if this will or should come across to younger viewers, or how parents or adults would or could guide them towards understanding what it's trying to say. And the film's trying to say A LOT. 
Raw 2016;10; istg this is the best movie I've ever seen in my whole entire lifeI (sadly) put off watching this for a long time BUT my god this movie is so disturbingly good in an addicting way. the ending will stick with me forever and i will be recommending this to everyone i encounter. 
Halloween Ends 2022;2; Mr. Gordon Green, what you've just made is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen, even by franchise standards. At no point in your rambling, incoherent movie were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this cinema is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you 1 star at letterboxd, and may God have mercy on the legacy of Halloween. 
The Good Nurse 2022;6; The two messages of this movie:1. Not having health insurance will kill you2. Having health insurance will kill you 
Aftersun 2022;8; Wanted to be cynical about this one but it’s just impossible, which became evident to me very quickly. On paper it’s like 90% happy memories, shot with such profound sadness I have no idea how it even got to the production stage. The only thing more depressing than Paul Mescal’s face is Paul Mescal’s face obscured by the flimsy nature of memory and the weathering of time. Pauline at the Beach on DMT. 
The Mercenary 1968;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn the same vein as Eastwood, Franco Nero seems to have built a career for himself by playing a type of outsider and anti-hero reminiscent of his most famous role, Django. This is complimented with his weapon of choice, a machine gun, that has certainly made me a fan of this weapon to the point where I wish more cowboy movies were made to duel and battle with this…  
Wayne's World 1992;8;  Another foundational film for me because it was the first place I learned about socialism (from Alice Cooper) and it made me horny (for Tia Carrera).The following Dana Carvey Garth bits KILLED me as a kid and still go hard:-his shy guy asides to the camera-"If you're going to spew, spew into this."-when he says "we fear change" to Rob Lowe and then starts hitting a robotic hand with a hammer.-Foxy Lady dance number-decked…  
Pearl 2022;8; The scarecrow scene is the saddest part.Oh, poor helpless scarecrow!He was raped against his will.Pearl should have used me instead. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; DON’T WORRY DARLING is certainly a film. Fulfilled with a score, cinematography, and performances, it’s a motion picture made by a group of filmmakers that can undeniably be stated as existent. Truly one of the films 2022 has to offer! 
Decision to Leave 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i buried my affection in deep ocean. come find me.  
Enola Holmes 2020;8; reading some of the reviews for this makes me so glad that i possess the (clearly uncommon) ability to have fun 
20th Century Girl 2022;8; "When I first came to Korea, I rarely had any reason to smile. Then I met you again. And I realized I was smiling whenever I looked at you."HE SAID HE WANTED TO SEE 21TH CENTURY BORA. CRYING MESS 
Amsterdam 2022;4;  this would have been way better if it was directed by Wes Anderson... my goodness. I think my rating is generous considering how boring and generic this film felt. Christian Bale and Margot Robbie try their hardest to keep this alive but the film fails at almost everything else. I will admit I was intrigued throughout the first 40 minutes of the film as it set up an interesting premise but it literally goes nowhere and just feels like a…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  it's way too fucking long + there are numerous aspects that feel stolen from the lion king. there's literally a shot of a sunset (rise? idk directions) with ahhhh semenyaaa esque music playing in the background. the accents are still really annoying and racist? some of y'all might think i'm making this up, but, one time, someone very sincerely told me "your accent is so pretty! i love african accents. i love black panther." note to non-africans: we do not…  
Girl, Interrupted 1999;10; when your circle small but y’all crazy 
(500) Days of Summer 2009;6; I thank (500) Days of Summer for introducing me to a band I’d never heard of before, The Smiths and I’m now officially OBSESSED with them 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; The was insane. Intentional or not, this was hilarious. So ridiculous and over the top. You got Jamie Lee walking around a changed woman with ugly old lady outfits and a new haircut. Deep narrations about evil not dying but changing shape. Comedic kills. It actually felt more apart of the Scream franchise than Halloween. So bad it’s good. Pretty damn fun. 
My Policeman 2022;8; men be like “i know a place” and it’s their gay lovers apartment 
Werewolf by Night 2022;8; why was gael garcía bernal still sexy in his werewolf form 
Men 2022;6; this was so scary im glad british people aren’t real

Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8; kanye definitely put this in his letterboxd top four with no hesitation 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Perfect execution, best movie in phase 4.Finally a marvel movie, this felt good to watch. Exciting villain great charcter building for everyone for redeeming. I’m so so so happy with this movie they did a great tribute and was very respectful of Chadwick boseman’s passing Ryan coogler did a fanatic job with a impossible challenge. Letitia wright did a brilliant job of taking the mantle of Black panther and Namor was a awesome villian who had a reasonable explanation…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; This movie makes fun of literally every single major political affiliation and social demographic and I love it 
The Good Nurse 2022;6; i can’t

Carrie 1976;8; Men be like this isn’t male gazy the extended shots of under age girls naked bodies are crucial to the plot you bitch 
Black Adam 2022;4; They seriously did the “what should we call you now” and then dramatic cut to title card ending. 
See How They Run 2022;10; who do i have to pay to get the bloopers from this movie. because i will pay. i’m serious. 
No Country for Old Men 2007;10;  15 year anniversary today for this all-time great. A rewatch wasn’t just a want, it was a need. This is probably THE film that got me into cinema. I love everything about it. One of the all time greatest on screen villains, Javier Bardem’s performance is undoubtedly one of my all time favourites. Every scene is chilling with a meaning. There is so many comments  on today’s society which can very much go unnoticed. The coin toss Is one of…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  <ENGLISH VERSION BELOW>Da, wo Hoffnung schwindet und die Wahrheit der hinterrücks geschaffenen ekstatischen Perspektive überkommt, verlaufen sich Erwartungen im anthologischen Sinne und Erwartungen im Index eines vereinzelten Vorschusses. Das kineastische Herangehen eröffnet zwei Pfade, welche stets am Ufer, das beide Potenzialitäten ineinander übergehen lässt, eine Entscheidung erwägen. Der erstere Weg würde den Bezug zu einem möglichen Vorgänger suchen. Innerhalb einer Trilogie entspricht dieser Weg selbsterklärend der normativen Realität, obgleich auch vergangene Reboots, oder erste Ableger mit inbegriffen sein können.…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; Intensiv, immersiv und richtig, richtig gut gespielt. Bisweilen hatte ich zwar das Gefühl, ein Best Of der wichtigsten Antikriegsfilme zu sehen, aber für deutsches Kino ist das hier erstaunlich! 
Do Revenge 2022;10; this is going to rock the socks off of the teens in the 2030s / 2040s 
Barbarian 2022;6; This movie was so hyped my expectations were actually low. Definitely not a boring movie but not scary at all. Weird definitely and kinda gross. I still don’t see why so many really liked it. If you want to check it out you can on HBO Max. 
My Policeman 2022;8; i actually cried so hard i almost threw up. i didn’t even get to drink my slushee. i walked out with a headache from crying and a melted blue slushee. i’m doing it all again tomorrow. 
American Psycho 2000;10; just imagined patrick bateman being a letterboxd user who writes detailed reviews of movies he’s watched and then breaking into a cold sweat after he sees that someone who wrote a one liner joke review got more likes than him 
Poltergeist 1982;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  ya sonofabitch ya MOVED the cemetery but ya left the bodies DIDN'T cha! ya sonofabitch ya left the bodies and ya only moved the headstooooooones! YA ONLY MOVED THE HEADSTOOOOOONES!!! WHYYYYYYY?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?  
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;8; maybe if the planets weren’t in retrograde this wouldn’t have happened 
The Blair Witch Project 1999;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  It's maybe good that these guys got lost and eaten or whatever, because before stuff starts going wrong it seems like their documentary was probably going to suck.  
My Policeman 2022;8; dude took fuck 12 a lil too literally 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; New beautiful poo cinema dropped. A bit sprawling but always at full steam — so visually engaging, loved the performances, very fun and yes, very full of poo! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a super-stuffed sequel (emphasis on the super) that’s definitely a little too long, but it’s a miracle to see a Marvel movie this well directed and shot (God bless Ryan Coogler and Autumn Durald Arkapaw), and when it hones in on its central themes about how consuming and corruptive grief can be, it does transcend and cut through all that cinematic universe noise. Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Tenoch Huerta are the standouts of an…

Es gab mal eine Zeit, in der die Visualität eines Films als einziger Angusspunkt zur Verbindung des Zuschauer galt - Die Bewegungen der Schauspieler des Verdrängens des auditiven Mangels angetan. Es war mal die Zeit, in welcher frühe Klassiker erschaffen wurden. Dann folgte die farbliche Aufbereitung der Filme, während die Epoche…

The Exorcist 1973;8;  <ENGLISH VERSION BELOW>Genrebasierte Bedingungen, die an Zeitpunkte geknüpft sind, stellen unlängst keine Außergewöhnlichkeit mehr dar: Halloween, die Hochzeit des Horrors, umwoben von feinsten Schreckens- und Leidensfiguren. Würde man einem Weihnachtsfilm im Sommer begegnen, wären folgende Reaktion Zeuge von zeitlicher Antipathie, denn das Genre, rund um das Weihnachtsfest geknüpft, ist viel gebundener, als der Horror. Sei es die immergleiche Thematik, welche auf den spirituellen Geist des Zuschauers aufspringt, oder allgemeingültig die musikalische Untermalung: Die Bindung des Zuschauers zählt einzig auf…

Dreams in the Witch House 2022;6; This is what I would imagine if Mike Flanagan made a live action Ratatouille 
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; As expected Wendell and Wild’s animation is super creative and the music is great. But I hate to say it was kind of a mess. It becomes very plot heavy and it’s evident in the last act that it had way too much on its plate as threads are rushed to their resolution. When the protagonist tells us how she grew in the end, it made me realize how much we lost her on the journey.It set up the delinquency / reformation theme well with the characters but stops at just telling us that it’s against private prisons. Good for you I guess? 
Wendell & Wild 2022;8;  “Pinch! Punch! Best of the month!”-Siobhan-Wendell & Wild is a visual carnival of psychedelic wonderment and devilish bemusement. What else would we expect from the delightfully wicked and cartoonishly twisted minds of Jordan Peele and Henry Selick. While a tad overstuffed in its heavy-handed messaging, it’s Imaginative Pinch! & Kooky Punch! make Wendell & Wild one of the best of the month! Henry Selick is a visionary director whom often gets unfairly left in Tim Burton’s shadow. His directorial work in…

The Great Silence 1968;10;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciConsidered by many to be Corbucci's masterpiece, this is one of those films that proves that contrary to popular belief, the wheel can be reinvented - or at least improved upon. Corbucci's depressing vision of the Western genre and the world at large was certainly a breath of fresh air in a genre that had grown stale and hackneyed. The story takes place just before the Great Blizzard of…  
See How They Run 2022;8;  “It’s okay everyone. I’m fine.”-Richard-See How They Run is a cheeky, if not over indulgent, homage to the countless murder mysteries of whodunnits past. While the central plot isn’t overly engaging or the big “reveal” all that surprising, See How They Run is still a case worth exploring. As lead inspector of this review I’ve come to the conclusion that See How They Run is *okay* everyone, it’s *fine*. See How They Run brandishes an antiquated style of…  
The Witch 2015;10; VVovv!! 
Black Adam 2022;8;  1. i have a low bar for these movies and that bar is “entertain me”2. for a studio that ditched zack snyder, wb sure did keep his aesthetic intact 3. the sequence where black adam returns after being gone for 5000 years and is floating in midair, lightning-killing bad guys, etc made me think of the old line “jesus is back…and he’s pissed”4. it’s hilarious that the justice society is introduced as if it’s been around forever in…  
Mulholland Drive 2001;10; Horrifying trash monster is THE most earned jump scare of all time.

Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies 2022;8; Me when I saw the teaser: A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.Me when I saw it's only 3 minutes long: Ghibli Star Wars production, you're shorter than I expected. Me after I watched it: I want more, and I know I shouldn't.

The Omen 1976;8; the kid just wants to ride his trike or whatever. everyone relax 
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;8; I was expecting a thriller and I was surprised by a reflective drama that is so current, so valid, so necessary. Mila Kunis urgently needs to leave her silly comedies and make more films that show her great talent like this one. Fabulous film!Final Score : 80% 🍎 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; “How’s the despair?” 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  Germany’s official entry for the Academy Awards in the Best International Film category is a harrowing anti-war film that doesn’t let the viewer look away from the bloodshed. If you are really into war films this will be right up your alley. If you’re into films as an art form you should have this on your watchlist. I haven’t read the classic novel and I haven’t seen the classic film adaptation so I won’t be bringing any kind of relevant…  
The Outside 2022;10; The week hasn’t given me time to write about every episode, but this one warrants a mention. While the first three were largely about malevolent fiends getting theirs in delightfully twisted ways, “The Outside” is different, following an insecure woman’s obsessive quest for transformation in sad and stomach-turning fashion. It’s Micucci’s Black Swan, and it’s Amirpour’s “Nosedive.” A hypnotic masterwork. 
Midsommar 2019;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  always great to see a feel-good movie about traveling, recognizing your worth & wearing fun new accessories as you leave a toxic relationship. :) getting rid of a shitty boyfriend can be a real bear.

Loss is an incredibly important element to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The story that follows grief, vengeance, boundaries, and new territories. For me, I felt as thought this story was about how Shuri has lost almost everything that she once considered normal in her everyday life. The feeling of having to fight for yourself because no…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  The world's superpower does its best to protect its nation from Mexicans illegally crossing its border.But seriously, did it need to be almost 3 hours long? This same story could have been told in 2 hours or less. It's one of those movies where if characters talked for like 10 minutes, they could avoid most of the film's conflict lmaoThe film felt unfocused and had large stretches in which almost nothing of import happened. I won't spoil the…  
Falling for Christmas 2022;6; lindsay lohan, christmas, straight rom-coms, cliche, what else could you ask for? 
The Chase 1946;8;  America’s postwar dreams warp both the psychology and the structure of director Arthur Ripley’s “The Chase.” One of the most unearthly and abstract of classic noirs, the film seems to exist on a plane of understanding only reached in the moment before waking up in a cold sweat in the dead of night. “The Chase” begins in convention, an ex-GI, Robert Scott, in need of a job, finds himself employed as the hapless chauffeur of a ruthless gangster. A gangster,…  
Django 1966;10;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciFor every great filmmaker, there is one film that marks the zenith of their career, the point at which they may retire with the assurance that their name will live on in the collective unconscious of moviegoers and film buffs alike, no matter what happens.Something that sprang to mind almost immediately was just how Django feels like a response to Leone and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name,…

Pearl 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Missed this in theaters sadly, but finally got to check this out at home today. Really loved this. The technicolor aesthetic and Wizard of Oz visual motif was really gorgeous to look at. Mild spoiler, but I absolutely loved the shot of Pearl chasing Mitzy down the path with the axe. Just beautifully shot. Mia Goth is a star and really looking forward to seeing more of her.  And absolutely cannot wait for Maxxxine.  Please, please, please more preplanned horror trilogies…   
Ticket to Paradise 2022;6; everybody get in here! it’s got bloopers! 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6;  If I were to rate this picture purely on the quantity of laughs, I would have to give it a low rating since I hardly laughed. However, even that comes with a caveat, as I watched it in one of the worst conditions imaginable: three hours of nonstop rain that seeped into my office. Maybe I'll have to give it another try in the future.With everything out of the way, this film is the epitome of a "amusing film."…

Rosaline 2022;8; my favourite part of the movie was paper rings by taylor swift playing in the credits 
Point Break 1991;8; Did an episode of We Hates Movies with Matt on this seminal entry in the 90s action canon. Johnny Utah is possibly the worst cop who has ever been depicted in film. NOBODY is worse at his job than him. He's still cool though.

Untold: The Rise and Fall of AND1 2022;6;  The second volume/season of UNTOLD has arrived to Netflix, bringing with it a slew of intriguing sports-related stories. I thoroughly loved the first installment, so I'm eager to see what the second part has in store for us.Unfortunately, the narrative structure of this first (second in order of release) episode is flawed. I can't remember who said it, but someone here stated that they wished they had focused more on the fall, and I agree. The entire documentary is…  
Full Metal Jacket 1987;10; War as hellish black box theatre, filled with as much corruption, perversion, and outright comedy as Kubrick’s other films on the subject. The blistering first half packs such a tragic punch that we remain in a state of dread until the credits roll, awaiting the next nightmare to greet our decidedly unheroic heroes. “John Wayne” was always a damaging idea. By the end, one soldier might have realized that. These kids never stood a chance. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  It’s… pretty good? Even though No Way Home wasn’t that long ago, it genuinely feels like this is the first time in a long time where a Marvel film has had actual stakes, finality and heart. It’s a shame because it’s still bogged down by unnecessary tertiary MCU-adjacent character fodder that serves as yet more breadcrumbing to future projects (thankfully, it’s ultimately kept to a minimum). The runtime also doesn’t feel nearly as long as seeing it on paper might…

It's so feckin' good, it'll make ya want to move to the motherland and raise a miniature donkey. Feckin' great time it is. Lot's of feckin' drama. Lot's of feckin' comedy.

Slumberland 2022;4;  I’m going to let you in on a little secret of the trade: Film critics actually want to love everything they watch. The odds may not always be in our favor, and certain assignments inspire lower expectations than others, but nobody shows up for work hoping to be miserable that day — least of all when they’re lucky enough to work a job that offers an occasional measure of outright transcendence.Which is all to say that, one of these…  
The Conjuring 2013;8; No matter how many times I watch this, I will always be surprised at how solid this is in terms of overall horror filmmaking. Uses the same stereotypes and tropes, but in a way which actually scares you and leaves you unsettled, especially in the first hour. Very decent indeed. 
Luzzu 2021;8;  One of the few great uses of the Ship of Theseus (humbly too), cleverly weaving scenes where parts are stripped and replaced and repaired throughout for what seems like no more than additional verisimilitude as well as a reinforcement of the literal labor of love put into old trades. A boat is a boat is a boat, it is and was a way of life that constitutes much more than just wood and nails – and yet such tradition is…  
Pig 2021;10; We don’t get a lot of things to really care about. It’s finally time I accept that this is one of my favorite movies ever, even though it completely obliterates me at the end.

And what kind of f--- up country you gotta be to allow that form of bullying in a public toilet in a workplace and don’t do anything?A film about the landmark case that helped enact subsequent laws preventing sexual harassment in the workplace that will certainly affect you in some manner. Charlize Theron (who I keep confusing with Nicola Kidman) was fantastic in this picture, even when some…

Halloween Ends 2022;6; I'm just going to state the obvious, they should have gone with Psycho Babysitter ft. Michael Myers instead of Halloween Ends. Also I'm sorry but all I could think of was how that mask must smell like rotten fish by now, Michael Raphael Leonardo Donatello Michelangelo Myers get out of those sewers you're embarrassing us. 
Beetlejuice 1988;8; I have said his name twice already today and I’m scared to type it out because idk if that counts as saying it a third time, so I’ll use emojis instead:…🪲🧃 freakin’ rocks. 
Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn't Exist 2022;8;  Unlike many apparently, I already knew about this event from one of Netflix's many documentary series on sports scandals, so this two-part episode wasn't exactly illuminating. If I'm not mistaken, we have more persons connected to the case speaking on the issue, particularly the catfisher herself, and more on the background of the key figures so there’s more depth.Anyway, it's an example of how sick but also somewhat convoluted all of this media exploitation can be, many of which…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;6; More fun that I expected, which isn’t surprising since it maintains the same energy of the first but with the added bonus of more Cavill. Leans a little bit too much into the 4th wall breaks, but the movie exudes so much charm, it’s mostly forgivable.Also, the mid-credit scene admittedly was very exciting.

Die Interpretation der unterschiedlichsten Medien verläuft unlängst nach keinem Schema mehr, denn gerade im filmischen Abteil, verweist allein der Bezug zu dem jeweiligen Film auf eine unabdingbare Intoleranz gegenüber anderen Thesen.

Saurians 1994;6;  Homemade dinosaur puppets rampage throughout Mark Polonia’s local woods. This film is a mess. The quality of the film stock is incredibly washed-out to the point where any light colored object is transformed into a blinding beam of whiteness. All the dialogue is dubbed in post and it’s awkwardness adds to the films strange vibe. The titular Saurians are poorly constructed puppets that occasionally switch to choppy stop-motion and are accompanied by hilariously bad green screen. There’s always a white…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Dedicated to our friend Chadwick BosemanSpoilers for the intro: I saw this with roughly 200 people and when the Marvel Studios intro crawl began and everyone quickly realized what Coogler had done to honor Boseman, there was a stillness that swept the crowd. It was incredibly quiet. A surreal moment I will not soon forget.MCU Ranked2022 Releases, ranked by me

Causeway 2022;8; Sometimes all you need is someone to drink coffee with in the mornings 
Black Adam 2022;4;  Black Adam is the antithesis of Marvel's Eternals. Where the latter takes its time with backstories and characters, Black Adam covers everything you need to know in seven minutes, and then it's 110 more minutes of mouthing off. This happens at such a pace that after the first half hour I had the feeling I had missed a non-existent prequel. One could easily make a whole movie about the prequel alone. Black Adam surges ahead with a pacing that is…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  This is so weird that it almost feels like a joke. Why can't they just make a simple Halloween sequel or ending? Michael and Laurie are the main characters, but for some reason, many people (who I really don't care about because they contribute nothing to the plot, other than getting killed) are sidelined, and the storyline focuses more on mini Michael and Laurie's granddaughter love affair and how mini Michael becomes a killer. Don't get me wrong, these aren't…

Halloween Ends 2022;8; Wacky!! So damn wacky and weird but kinda wonderful at the same time. For a bit I was thinking this is so dumb and barely feels like a Halloween movie but once I got into the groove of it I was thinking this is a bop I like this. Some good slasher fun, very different in tone to the others but still plenty of great entertainment value. My biggest question is why didn’t we get to hear Jamie Lee say TRWALMA? 
Knife+Heart 2018;10;  Has a special place in my heart for being the first queer movie I so viscerally connected with and, to this day, remains firmly at the top. In hyper-stylizing the grimier aspects of queer media that I normally find fairly frivolous it manages to evoke a feeling of arousal, revulsion, and, most unusual of all, immaculacy, that last aspect the one that transforms what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill erotic horror flick into something truly sublime. Editing, audio design, costuming,…

Decision to Leave 2022;6;  A bit of a disappointment considering how much I was looking forward to it and how much I like everything else I've seen from Park Chan-Wook. This one is just far too over-plotted and hyper-stylized to the point of confusion, haphazardly constructed in a way where the haphazardness of it overwhelms the intent and emotion behind its particular construction.

The animation is remarkable, particularly in terms of the design of the characters and the overall universe. The music is really excellent and catchy.All in all, there are no words really…

Die Begrifflichkeit der Perfektion, nicht missverstehend mit dem Anschein einer perfektionierten Absicht, kollidiert mit der subjektiven Aufnahme eines jeden Zuschauers. Schließlich verkommt neben Offensichtlichkeiten, das Empfinden der inneren Praktifizierungen des lodernden Gedanken eines jeden Regisseurs: Die vergebene Schönheit des Filmemachens kollidiert mit dem Lauf der Zeit.So gern die Problematik der stetigen Veröffentlichungen auch revidiert werden möchte, trotz klassifizierender Stärken, ist The Dark…  
The Good Nurse 2022;6; THE GOOD NURSE is a cold, detached & slightly overlong procedural thriller elevated by the always reliable Jessica Chastain and a bone-chilling turn from Eddie Redmayne. His unsettling performance is one of his most magnetic & convincing, especially in the third act.

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  This is such an Irish movie. Darkly funny. Melancholic and depressing, yet simultaneously almost sweet and hopeful. Colm (Brendan Gleeson) one day seemingly just decides he no longer likes his best friend Pádraic (Colin Farrell). Pádraic’s existence is essentially turned upside down. The fictional island of Inisherin is depicted as just off the coast of Ireland’s mainland. Close enough to see and hear bombardments of the Irish Civil War, but disconnected enough to not have a dog in the fight. As Pádraic desperately seeks…

Smile 2022;6; I need someone to explain to me why Kyle Gallner’s character had that sweet Italian-language poster of Downhill Racer prominently displayed in his apartment. (This was better than expected, but largely because Finn is way better at creature work and gore than psychological thematic exploration and that counts for a lot with me.) 
Terrifier 2 2022;6; 55Stuffed to the seams. A splatter epic that is certainly on my shortlist of gnarliest films viewed at a Marcus Theatre. Legitimately gruesome and upsetting. Art the Clown is still stronger as a concept than a narrative basis, but Terrifier 2 is definitely more successful than the first film. Ambitious and weird. Between this and The Munsters, it's been a good month for movies that function primarily as halloween fetish objects.

Don't Worry Darling 2022;6;  If 20 minutes in you can already predict the whole concept behind the final twist then your film has a problem.It’s like Olivia Wilde watched Get Out and felt she could do the white woman version of it.

Causeway 2022;6; Filmmakers are often derided for their overindulgence. Lila Neugebauer may not be indulgent enough. Thankfully, Causeway is able to showcase two central performers with enough charisma and skill to cut through all that directorial restraint. In the end, this a stripped back indie drama focused on trauma, with all of the benefits and limitations that entails.

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  Wait… the Roku original biopic on Weird Al is actually pretty good??? YES! It’s really fun! Daniel Radcliffe is super fun in the role and the movie is filled with fun cameos that add to the comedy in the film. Not just cameos for cameo sake. The film acknowledges Al’s parody sensibilities and the movie itself is kind of a parody of reality. I think that is a nice touch and adds a sense of uniqueness and a zany funhouse…

Halloween Ends 2022;6;  The alleged end to the Laurie Strode saga takes some incredibly big swings, which I admit I respect, but the creative choices feel mostly pointless by time the credits roll. This will undoubtedly be one of the most divisive Halloween yet and while I think the choices that were made were not inherently terrible, it may have been better suited to start them in the previous film because it feels incredibly rushed in this one. Choices aside, the movie strangely doesn’t…  
Love Today 2022;8;  A wildly entertaining quirky romcom, loaded with hilarious laugh out loud situational-observational humor n decent emotions. Pradeep takes his wacky short film idea and stretches it out into an crowd pleasing feature narrative with smart creative edit choices, exploring the dynamics of contemporary love in the ‘dark secret’ social media era, mostly from an even handed perspective. Though it treads at a surface level with few flat n exaggerated scenes, it manages to stack up one relatable event after the…  
The Good Nurse 2022;8; Imagine being the person that highly recommended him 
Black Adam 2022;6;  After his announcement decades ago when he was still wearing diapers, we finally get a chance to see Dwayne Johnson's debut in the DC universe as the now anti-hero Black Adam. Plus, it's the DC/Marvel crossover I never expected to see.And I'm torn about it. On the one hand, I appreciated how the film stretched the PG-13 rating with some pretty brutal and "graphic" deaths and action sequences. Also, despite their clumsy introduction, I liked the addition of the…  
Ticket to Paradise 2022;8; i’m gonna need a new george clooney & julia roberts romcom every year from now until the end of time 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Es wäre so einfach für Martin McDonagh gewesen, nach dem Oscar-Erfolg von “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” den unvermeidlichen Lockrufen aus Hollywood zu folgen und als nächstes ein großes Star-Vehikel mit Millionenbudget zu drehen (siehe Damien Chazelles Babylon). Aber McDonagh war und ist in erster Linie immer ein Geschichtenerzähler, der sich lieber zurückzieht und an einer kleinen, stillen Geschichte über zwei Freunde schreibt, die eines Tages keine Freunde mehr sein wollen. Natürlich ist die Auflösung dieser Prämisse, so kennt man…  
Lot 36 2022;6; Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities- Episode 1Storage Wars but make it scary. Excels aesthetically, but not the most revolutionary in terms of its story. Which I suppose isn't entirely negative, but just as the story starts to get really interesting, it ends. A fine first episode to the anthology, can we put Tim Blake Nelson in everything? 
20th Century Girl 2022;10; r u fucking kidding me. 
V/H/S/99 2022;2;  Can you imagine a horror anthology where not even one segment is good? V/H/S/99 is so atrocious it makes Viral feel like an instant horror classic. If V/H/S/94 still shows hope, 99 proves it's really time to retire the franchise.V/H/S/99 consists of 5 stories that bomb one after another, with only glimpses of the past glory.-Shredding: underwhelming starter, where a banal premise of haunted house leads to nothing substantial. At least the music rocks.-Suicide Bid: another overdone…  
Entergalactic 2022;8; Kid Cudi got high doing a When Harry Met Sally and Spider-Verse double feature and said “hold up, what if.” 
Falling for Christmas 2022;10;  We’ve been waiting for this day for what feels like centuries, and now it’s finally here. It’s the return of one of the greatest titans that the film industry has ever known, whose projects have collected countless accolades and changed cinema as an art form several times over. After years of delays, detours, and demolished dreams, the time has come to once again let movies whisk us away to another world.I am, of course, talking about Lindsay Lohan’s return…  
Beau Travail 1999;10; I know the message I’m supposed to receive from this film is definitely not that being colonized by the French is a sexy good time, yet here we are. 
See How They Run 2022;8; My main complaint is the criminal lack of marketing this movie received, because it’s a hoot. A solid whodunnit that maybe isn’t earth shattering in its reveal, but it’s effortlessly funny and wraps in 98 minutes. A swell time at the movies.Also, put Saoirse Ronan in everything 
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004;10; this also happened when i dyed my hair 
Dead Poets Society 1989;10; i never thought i would be crying in the club over a bunch of rich look alike gay white boys but here we are 
TÁR 2022;10;  For 2 hours and 38 minutes my eyes were glued to the screen and my soul belonged to Todd Field and Cate Blanchett. Not a single beat wasted, every moment seamlessly bleeds into the next. It’s actually incredible how much Tár takes on and does so with immense poise. Never overwhelmed and always on key, the story of a conductors downfall and her descent into madness is like a watching a nightmare unravel. Blanchett is immaculate, nothing short of perfection and…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; can’t believe there was all that drama on set for such a mediocre film 😭 
Bullet Train 2022;8; aaron taylor mother fucking johnson smoking a cigarette like a slut is enough reason for you to see this movie. 
Get Out 2017;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  the last scene where he deadass raises his hands when he sees the cop car even though hes the victim is highkey the most powerful thing ive ever seen im ready to sucker punch a white man

Werewolf by Night 2022;4; This is what an “Old Movie” Instagram filter looks like. Nevertheless, I like the idea of a 55-minute Marvel movie. I think we should keep getting that number further down. 
The Thing 1982;10;  Movie: The ThingDirector: John CarpenterRelease Date: 25 June 1982:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:The mere concept alone is a worthy enough reason to give John Carpenter's The Thing a watch. Taking a step into their shoes, anyone of us would do the same. The Thing REEKS of suspicion and untrustworthiness. Not even MacReady or Childs can be trusted, given that even they make poor decisions from time to time.This I feel is the strength of the movie. When compared to the…

Jennifer's Body 2009;10; ''i go both ways'' shakespeare couldn't do it 
Terrifier 2016;4;  pretty impressively vile, low-rent stuff that i can't help but wish amounted to a bit more than a splatter demo reel. just has very little mood and very few places to go after we're introduced to art's literal bag of tricks. i want to respect that exploitation simplicity but it's harder to do when it has the visual ambition/imagination of an ugly 2015 youtube era short. hoping the sequel has better horror filmmaking instincts than to get to its gnarliest…  
Black Adam 2022;6; Heroes do love to put their villains in prison 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; Seems like Weird Al went through his Wikipedia page and just changed the words. It’s confusing and evil and I will not have that kind of blasphemy in my own home! 
Barbarian 2022;6;  In this devilish treat of a film, a young woman discovers that the rental home she booked has already been occupied by a stranger. What happens next is something that you would have to uncover for yourself. Zach Cregger in his solo directorial debut, utilizes every horror film trope possible and inverting it and blowing it out on our faces. Barbarian delivers the cheap thrills, but also it offers a tricky game for its audiences in seeking out answers to…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; the marvel studios logo in this is literally the saddest fucking thing i have ever seen 
Black Adam 2022;6; I will say though, I’ll be straight in line to see Pierce Brosnan as Dr Fate again 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; Academy Award winner Brendan Gleeson just rolls of the tongue, doesn’t it? 
TÁR 2022;8;  a real Performance movie — one that works so well because it is Blanchett (she fills nearly every scene of the 158-minute runtime, she makes every minute of it compelling, in a career of bests, this one especially blew me away). But it works, to a quieter degree, because of Nina Hoss, who plays Lydia Tár's wife. I loved what Cate said about Nina at the press conference: "The creative conversation was so elevated [...] when [Nina Hoss] came on board,…

Running with the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee 2022;6;  I'm not sure which podcast it was, but I remember hearing by chance about the wild life and legal troubles of John McAfee, the founder of one of the antivirus software that has become synonymous with this type of programs, where the man went insane and started living in the jungle and such. So, when I spotted this documentary on Netflix, I raced to see it the same day, and well, what can I say?In terms of depicting this…  
O Brother, Where Art Thou? 2000;8;  myth mishmash on the mississippi. a tenderly chiseled world, an idiosyncratic maverick. hillbilly & bluegrass musical meets greek road movie. John Goodman bible belting through this odyssey. the corrupted potbelly wears his ku-klux-cappy while shaking a leg as the election folks like to see it. he knows what's lifting the mood up. black musicians sell their soul to the devil while mermaids transform our antiheroes into toads. all they have left is their dapper dan pomade. "never trust a female delmar,…  
Werewolf by Night 2022;4; 38Certainly not unwatchable but even as a TV-special clocking in at under an hour, this 'universal horror' homage is far from the stylistic hallmarks of a Carl Laemmle Jr. production. Once again, Marvel likes to place itself in the conversation of what it references while not bringing any sort of ambition to the table. This is boring and aimless. It's a cute curiosity, but it's not worth much in the end. 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; me with an insulin pump attached to me while watching this ha ha ha…… 
The Autopsy 2022;8; Now we're talkin’. The Autopsy is much more my speed. Tonally consistent, well-acted, and confidently directed by David Prior. This one feels like a forbidden episode of the X-Files. More please. 
Pornostar 1998;8;  It always thrills me to discover a movie about which I knew very little and end up loving it.This picture, which has the trappings of a "yakuza" film, runs at the same breakneck pace as a Kitano film, albeit with less action and more psychological and surreal moments. It's a movie that opts for a more meditative approach, which, in my opinion, makes the violent scenes—whether they involve a stabbing, a beating, or just visuals like water turning into…

American Psycho 2000;10;  Me: Do you like Mary Harron’s adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho? Snooty Film Analyst: It’s OK. Me: The later scenes are a little too abstract for my tastes, but when Bateman’s monologuing carries on throughout all 102 minutes, I think it really comes into its own, commercially and artistically. The whole film has a clear, crisp look, and an old sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives Andrzej Sekula’s cinematography a big boost. Mary Harron's been compared to…  
Masters of the Universe 1987;6; Not to be rude but He-Man seems like kind of a boring guy 
The Thing 1982;10; 100% pure horror.100% complete paranoia.100% practical effects.100% proof that horror doesn't need CGI.100% inimitable.100% Carpenter100% timeless. (it's 38 years old!!)100% terrifying. Still.100% visual masterpiece.100% mold breaking.1000% One of my favourite horror films ever made.p.s. Math was never my strong point. 
Wendell & Wild 2022;8; Grateful to have an animated movie made for goth punk weirdos for the first time in like a decade 
Rosaline 2022;8; the way Dario was 100x hotter than Romeo… was yelling at Rosaline the whole time 
Hellraiser 2022;4;  Hate to be the stick in the mud on this one - especially considering how much I loved Bruckner's THE NIGHT HOUSE - but it just doesn't work for me. It's too long, the new Cenobite designs are too glossily plastic (not to mention weirdly sexless), the mythology is a muddled mess, and it leans way too heavily on modern elevated horror trappings in order to get going (why do we have to sit through another sad addiction movie?). Kept…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;8; Breaking: Key & Peele have gone goblin mode 
Ready or Not 2019;10; in the name of the father (parasite), the son (knives out) and the holy spirit (ready or not) 
Saw 2004;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  sure cancer may be killing john kramer but lets not act like lying face down on that germy ass bathroom floor for a good 7 hours helped him at all  
Psycho 1960;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  If someone offers you milk with dinner like that's an acceptable beverage you can automatically assume they are mentally ill.  
The Fly 1986;8; Peter Parker had it easy. 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; The mystery adventure sequel rightly make amends at the weak links of its first part, coming up with a much better-darker mystery storyline and clever narrative to support it this time around. Though not without ups n downs, its pretty well paced for most parts with good action sequences and humor. Millie Bobby Brown, once again is charming all the way and delivers a much controlled performance. As her sibling, Henry Cavill is solid and feels just the perfect choice. It does drag a bit towards the end, but nevertheless ends up an entertaining fun filled watch. 
Piggy 2022;6; I was expecting this to be yet another bullying victim gets revenge film but, although it takes that concept, it's more than that. They made a good job building up the suspense until the final act, and in the meantime we are introduced not only to Sara and her family but everyone and how bullying and body shaming are part of Sara's daily life and what she's been through, so by the end we can understand her choices. It's not a masterpiece but for something that could have easily been nothing new, it's okay. 
Rosaline 2022;8; Need another hour of Rosaline and Dario getting into mischief 
Evil Dead II 1987;10; fuck anyone who thinks "groovy" isn't the best line in all of cinema

Terrifier 2016;4;  Terrifier 2 better be better than this one beside y’all are hyping it up like crazy.I respect the shit outta what they were able to accomplish here with essentially no money, but that also comes with an inevitable downfall. The presentation of this film and the aesthetic that made it look like it was shot on an iphone 4 took away from any attempt at frightening me. While the gore was present, this film lacked any real stakes or…

Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  FINALLY a netflix story that is truly worth to become a trilogy! what an wonderful film! the pacing of this one is still as slow at the first but as well is way more interesting and gets better and better as the time passes, the 2 hours run wasn't a problem like its prequel.and... more of henry cavill and helena bonham, i was counting on that and i'm glad i wasn't disappointed!the villains this time around were all…  
Smile 2022;8;  i've said in the past that the problem with every "about trauma" horror movie is that they're never really willing to probe what causes trauma. trauma is just a sort of vague catch-all metaphor for whatever Negative Force the protagonist is up against. so what i liked so much about Smile is how it amps that problem up so much that it wraps back around to being good again. like i think you could genuinely read this movie as a…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; Absolutely riotous, irreverent, and biting satire about class and social roles. Some of the hardest laughs I’ve gotten from a film in a while. Goes in some wild directions so when this comes out go in blind for a good time. 
Entergalactic 2022;8;  It's an experimental type of animation that uses a basic love story with a simple plot and characters to present a collage of multisensory art. We see the world through Jabari's eyes, and because he's an artist, we get to see his colorful, comic book and street art aesthetic world. It's quite captivating, reminding me of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Facial expressions are real. Emotional reactions are relatable. Moments are memorable. I must say that Kid Cudi's soundtracks really elevate…

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998;10;  First of all, I have never watched Snatch, but here we have an earlier British black comedy crime movie also directed by Guy Ritchie that I really enjoyed.Budget: $1.400.000Box office: $28.100.000It’s about a poker player/card sharp, who after losing a big amount of his and his gang’s money, has to find a solution to fix all the problems and pay off his debts.It has a really entertaining premise which is a bit messy developed, it mixes…  
Nope 2022;10; can’t believe that wishing well takes such beautiful vsco pictures 
We're All Going to the World's Fair 2021;8;  this movie reminded me of two things:1. this one time i was on shrooms and somehow ended up on a twitch stream by a user named "lil cocksucker" and he was just some like 19 year old kid in a shitty bedroom with his mattress pushed up against the wall getting drunk off a handle of jack and doing yo yo tricks and giving weird dating advice to no one. i started interacting with him and getting him to…  
The Outside 2022;6; The Shape of Lotion 
Black Adam 2022;6; I've never felt so aggressively neutral towards a comic book movie before 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  I haven't read the novel, but I assume this is what a perfect adaptation looks like.All Quiet on the Western Front is Germany’s stylistic antithesis to 1917. 1917 was a beautiful film, and while All Quiet on the Western Front is certainly a well shot film, it is anything but beautiful. This is a haunting, devastating film.All Quiet on the Western Front is a very raw film. They don't hold your hand, and they don't pull any punches.…  
Little Miss Sunshine 2006;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  dwayne's first word in nine months being "fuck" is very relatable  
Barbarian 2022;8;  Caught up on this much talked about horror film late, Barbarian is the newest big studio horror film that surprisingly got a lot of buzz when it dropped in early September. Now, after seeing this in the comfort of my own home, I can say that the hype is all totally worth it, this is a solid and terrifying little flick. The best part of this film is going in absolutely blind in what the film is actually about, so…  
Jennifer's Body 2009;8; the fact that the scene when needy says “you’re killing people!” and then jennifer goes “no, i’m killing boys” didn’t make it to the final cut of this movie is a hate crime i think 
Midsommar 2019;10; i am SO glad ari aster clearly never went to therapy 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I got to see this for free and still wanted a fucking refund.This movie makes some of the other movies I've rated 1/2 a star seem so much better.I'm sorry if this review offends you and if you like this movie. I can't even in my right mind imagine someone thinking this is good. This is a pointless film that doesn't even pay tribute to Boseman in a good way.Everything was downhill from the red hot chilli…   
Once Upon a Time in the West 1968;10;  After the success of the stylistic spectacle of The Dollars Trilogy director Sergio Leone returns to familiar ground. This time he's come for the blood of the critics that accused him of being "style over substance". The script, aided by Argento and Bertolucci, could not be improved by adding a single word, nor omitting one. It captures the struggle between the Old West and the dawning of civilisation. A town will be built no matter what, either by blood money…  
Argentina, 1985 2022;8; Quiero usar este espacio para recordar, sonriendo, que el hijo de re mil puta se murió cagando en una cárcel común. Muchas gracias.

See How They Run 2022;8;  An artfully filmed story about London's theater stages at their worst and best. It was such a breath of fresh air because it makes no pretense of being high art. It's silly and enjoyable, like eating a good piece of cake - colorful and pleasurable, and hoping to stay with you forever. I'm not sure if it's because of the cozy cinematography, the numerous tracking shots, or the two actors who have appeared in a number of popular films, but…  
The Eternal Daughter 2022;8; AFI 2022: film #9“the longer we’re here, the more it comes back”nothing in the world more interesting or complex than the relationships we have with our mothers and all the muddled misremembering, overthinking and projecting we’ll do regarding them until the day we die. how silly!!!

Leave Her to Heaven 1945;8;  Noir knows no wrath like a woman scorned. Or, worse, a woman who perceives herself to be in the constant state of insufficient love. “Leave Her to Heaven” has the lush saturation and rustic chic environs of a 1940s travel ad for a northeast’er train line. It vibrates under its deceivingly pleasant masquerade of being one of the few classical era ‘color noirs.’ But just like a mask, just like flimsy paper of a travel poster - the idea that…  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;8; I found it fun FAWK the gossip. Bring me the sequel. 
Notting Hill 1999;6; so like.....his book store only sold travel books??? thats got to be the worst business idea ever 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; What in the Avatar/Aquaman…I’ve gotta say this was a lot of fun. Way longer than it needed to be but still thoroughly enjoyable. Angela Bassett was an absolute standout. She really brought her acting chops to this one. Florence Kasumba was also hilarious. A lot of emotional moments throughout. Feeling slightly better about the MCU and primed for Avatar 2. 
Godzilla vs. Biollante 1989;8;  A Walk Amongst Monsters #63“We are a lethal weapon!”At what point are you considered a mad scientist? I’m going with “combining Godzilla’s cells with a rose containing your dead daughter’s soul” as the threshold.I mean, it’s one way to create your Kaiju opponent. And luckily enough it’s the good guy! But unfortunately it’s a plant and Godzilla breathes atomic fire, the odds aren’t in your favor is what I’m saying.This keeps with the Cold War tensions…

The Good Nurse 2022;6;  This is fine. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant along with Jessica Chastain delivering an expectedly solid performance. It’s slow paced and subtle, don’t expect an edge of your seat crime film, however, that’s not entirely a negative. This film does well in a few different areas. The clever use of dark, gritty visuals and lighting. The slow build of suspense left me in anticipation for what was going to happen next without feeling overwhelmed. The issues with this film for me lie…

Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;2;  I will preface this review by sharing that I work in depression and suicide research, teach mental health in schools, and am a suicide survivor. It was impossible to view this documentary without my personal and academic background shaping my opinion. I believe Selena Gomez is a kind person with good intentions. We even have the same semicolon tattoo. However, her efforts in the mental health space began with her producing 4 seasons of a Netflix show that researchers discovered…  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10;  selena gomez has been in my life ever since disney. I’ve supported her through her acting and music career and I’ve never been prouder, she means the absolute world to me and just a huge inspiration. watching this, I had to prevent the tears from running but it fails because I just couldn’t stop crying. I was hurting for her. this movie gives a true authentic view on her and doesn’t sugar coat what she was dealing with her mental…  
Psycho 1998;4;  Say what you will about the staff, the water pressure in the Bates Motel shower looks really solid. There’s nothing worse than a hotel shower that feels like you’re standing under a drippy garden hose. Okay, maybe there are some things that are worse...To me, Gus Van Sant’s Psycho is a fascinating if failed experiment, and a huge missed opportunity. Because one of the things Hitchcock’s Psycho did that was so revolutionary was the way it shocked audiences by…  
Where the Crawdads Sing 2022;4; This is a small and stupid detail but if she grew up completely isolated in the marsh away from society why does she have curtain bangs 
Black Swan 2010;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  sometimes i, too, cry when i realise that i stabbed myself and not my arch nemesis that i wanted to sleep with who was me in my mind from time to time but also a different person in real life. but only sometimes.  
Barbarian 2022;6;  Here's the thing. It's good, has an original plot, definitely didn't see any of that coming, and the acting was alright but I'm not a fan of the way it was told, there were many questions lingering around and I hate AJ with his whole unnecessary subplot before going into the house.

La Haine 1995;10; this made me VERY upset 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  NO SPOILERSI remember the day that Chadwick Boseman passed away. We were in the middle of a raging pandemic and I was invited to go to Walt Disney World because the attendance rate was devastatingly low. With my masks, germy gel, and all the caution in the world, I went because a free ticket is a free ticket. As I entered the Disney Clothiers store and picked up a brand new Black Panther mask, I was finally ready to…  
The Crow 1994;8; This movie and its soundtrack were very important to me in 7th and 8th grade.

Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;8; BFI London Film Festival 2022: Film #11The best part about the world premiere was the host explicitly saying that this is NOT a kids film with a bunch of children in the audience, and then Del Toro just casually dropping the f bomb.

Smile 2022;8; Nice little cameo appearance from the Barbarian 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; DONT BUY BLACK MIRROR FROM SHEIN!!!!! ban harry styles from the film sets. they were laughing at his monologues at my showing. several racially motivated(???) moments that no one is mentioning idk kiki layne deserved an actual character given that she is the catalyst for pretty much the entire story. other than that i kinda saw the vision im not even gonna lie

Pulp Fiction 1994;6; a good movie but god imagine my fucking disappointment when i found out the movie wasn't all about mia wallace nobody cares about you bruce willis 
Rorschach 2022;8; A slow burn psychological revenge thriller, one that’s neatly executed with top performances and technical values. When looking at the storyline, it’s pretty much simple, but the complexly structured narrative evokes enough curiosity and makes it a worthy stimulating experience. It carries a sinister tone right through with well timed effective twists. The cinematography and editing deserve special mention. Also, the English songs with situational lyrics adds an interesting touch. Mammootty and rest of cast deliver strong performances. The disturbing experimental drama does have a few glitches and demands your patience at times, but once you buy in, it definitely ends up a rewarding watch. 
Black Panther 2018;10;  🍿 Check out my Marvel Cinematic Universe rankings here!🔜 Check out my Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) review here!“It is your time to be king” 😭😭😭I don’t think this movie is overrated at all. It’s an amazing story with a powerful and compelling plot and amazing world building. I actually LOVE the world-building for this movie. The world of Wakanda is so much bigger than the MCU and is just breathtakingly gorgeous.Downplaying this movie is a…  
Bros 2022;4; a few chuckles i guess and fairly handsomely shot by brandon trost but considering what its goals are... kind of weird how dramatically limp and non-specific (even for the genre!) this is. the basic rhythm of the comic beats aren't even cut right and it moves through the formula at such a painfully glacial pace that despite being approx. 30 minutes shorter than the average one, it somehow feels longer than an apatow movie. 
My Policeman 2022;8; I’m starting to suspect they may have been more than friends. 
See How They Run 2022;8; Finally checked this one off my watchlist. Tight, witty, nothing flashy. I am in love with Saoirse Ronan. Full review will (hopefully) be on Letterboxd soon. 
Taxi Driver 1976;10; at the end of the day, it's just me and my taxi driver rewatch agains the world 
Blonde 2022;2; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I hated almost everything about this. It gets +1/2 a star for some cool dreamy transitions here and there, and Ana De Armas' acting was mostly good. Everything else was distasteful. A torture porn compilation of Marilyn's most horrific moments. The worst part being, it's based on a book filled with falsehoods making Marilyn's life out to be far worse than it was. Another ironic capitalization of a woman's life which was, and continues to be, endlessly exploited, and this…

TÁR 2022;8;  she’s innocent #LetTárCookI’m always weary of new films being hyped off the fact that they’re “real dramas for adults”, because it more-so reflects the failing industry than the film itself. this is a 10/10 adjusted for 2022 deflation, but let’s not put it in the history books as a masterpiece quite yet. the film peaks early with the Julliard scene (truly masterful!), but once the dramatic seeds are planted they don’t lead me anywhere particularly enticing. Field is very…

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Academy award winner Colin Farrell sounds really nice right now, doesn't it?It feels as though I've been anticipating this one for an eternity, but thankfully, the wait was entirely worth it. To me, The Banshees of Inisherin is near flawless, Im struggling to find any fault in it. Even more points are awarded when it comes to the incredible performances and stunning visuals. Martin McDonagh ily <3

My Policeman 2022;4; alright I think we can safely put the whole Harry Styles The Movie Star experiment to rest 
Not Okay 2022;6;  To be quite honest, I had no intention of watching this film, but the backdrop image of Zoey looking very hot piqued my attention. I realize it's an odd reasoning, but what can I say?In terms of the film, the message is good and relevant, the soundtrack is great, and Mia Isaac was unquestionably the best part of the whole thing, but everything else falls flat. Zoey was nice, but her character is not only obnoxious, but also one-dimensional…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;4;  The one time I interviewed Ruben Ostlund, we talked about nature films -  how he was interested not only in patterns of behaviour, but the actual clustering and migration of animals through their environment, which he found dramatic on a purely abstract, visual level. Where both  PLAY and FORCE MAJEURE channel this sensibility interestingly - potential predators and their prey, herd mentalities at work -   THE SQUARE and now TRIANGLE OF SADNESS mostly sideline it to focus on the comedy…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  As civil war ignites in the background, another spot of infighting simmers on the isle of Inisherin, a fictional locale that feels no less identifiably desperate than the Quick Stop from Clerks or the bar from Horace and Pete. In other words, it’s not always a place that people leave, but it’s always a place that people need to leave. Martin McDonagh’s latest is the story of two men who haven’t, one woman who might, and the guaranteed hell that…  
Misery 1990;10;  This is a top 5 King movie adaptation for me. That puts Rob Reiner in the same category with Kubrick, Carpenter, Cronenberg, and De Palma. Amazing script from William Goldman, not a word wasted. For me, this movie is of a part with One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest as films from different eras that channel the same fear of American society and masculinity being subjugated to monstrous female authority through the professional spheres such as teaching, nursing, the law,…

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;10; OMG THAT FINALE WAS SOO GOOD. i really enjoyed it. it was so fun and creative. i didn’t expect that at all. idc what anyone says this was really good. i don’t get why it’s getting so much hate. saying the jokes are bad and cringe but if it was deadpool making jokes like that y’all won’t say anything. jen breaking the 4th wall and when she said “when are we getting the x men” she knows what’s up. i was expecting kevin feige to show up😭i cant wait to see more of jen and more of her w matt. i love them together 
Smile 2022;4; takes the phrase would it kill you to smile a bit too seriously 
Coraline 2009;10; is this what it’s like to be an only child 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  It felt like an episode of a random Netflix show. I mean, there's nothing new here, and it outstays its welcome long before the credits roll. Florence Pugh, my dear, you're always doing great, but you've gotten yourself into a situation that even you can't fix.Despite the two-hour length, there wasn't much explaining. What about the plane, for example? workers in red suits? Jack dancing himself to exhaustion? Gemma Chan in a completely unnecessary role? What about Alice's reset?…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;8;  They say everyone's got demons, right? My demons have names. It's natural to compare Wendell & Wild to Coraline, but it's also unfair considering Coraline reaches a prestige few animated films can parallel. But Wendell & Wild still offers as much creativity and beauty as Coraline, just slightly less polished. Like all Selick's previous work, the stop-motion animation is flawless. It's an animation style that is inherently creepy thus its application to a movie about death and demons only amplifies the macabre…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Outrageously irreverent and funny. You'll most likely either agree or hate it. It deflates a bit in part three. The dramatic structure is a triangle- and ultimately that makes it climax at a weird place. There's almost no subtext here, the whole thing is viciously on-the-nose, but I don't know that's part of the fun. 
Silent Hill 2006;8; just the great video game film. the music. the fades to black.

You’re missing your husband’s oddly spontaneous trance dancing.”

TÁR 2022;10;  5 stars on rewatch. Updated thoughts below. Cate Blanchett is incredible. Period. Full stop. Really loved this. Initially this felt like an examination of so many things: cancel culture, the corruptive nature of power, hierarchy and privilege….and much, much more. Yet, in the end I had the feeling that these topics aren’t really argued to conclusion, rather they’re presented here, like a prompt to a 10 page essay.  And we, the audience, are intended to scrawl out some truths from this…  
Terrifier 2 2022;2; Yeah okay this settled it for me horror fans just love scrimblo 
Pearl 2022;10;  So, i actually wasn't that excited for Pearl. I liked X well enough, but it didn't really blow me away, and i thought a prequel was in danger of being superfluous, or even worse, complicating or cheapening the good qualities of the original installment.I was very wrong.Pearl is gorgeous, a technicolor, old-Hollywood style Deranged. Not only does it not cheapen X, it enrichens it at every turn and makes the character of Pearl an icon. Mia Goth carries…  
Shoot First… Ask Questions Later 1975;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn the past year, I've had the pleasure of exploring Terence Young's filmography for the first time, and among the titles I've watched is Red Sun, which I found to be quite enjoyable. Corbucci opted to spoof the film, suggesting that it wasn't all that obscure as I initially thought. This was the director's last stab at the Western genre.The cast is mostly too good to fail, and…  
Emma. 2020;8; you: oh I remember this scene from the book me, an intellectual: oh I remember this scene from clueless (1995) 
Causeway 2022;8;  Causeway is surprisingly watchable and a film that could be too bleak to truly enjoy. With this kind of heavy material, there's always a chance of the film being too depressing for its own good. The film handles the sensitive subject matter very well. It provides just enough context at the depressing battle that this woman is going through mentally and physically due to brain trauma while serving in the military. It balances that with some truly touching, heartfelt, and…  
Scream 1996;10; ghostface when i don't answer the phone for the 17th time: is this bitch for real 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8; Don’t ever show me Pete Davidson without tattoos again, it’s gross

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; the final scene broke me like nothing else oh wow chadwick boseman's presence is everywhere here and this is truly such a beautiful tribute to a man who will forever be missed 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; I think this was a hard film to accomplish because of the gravity of chadwicks passing. The cast did immeasurably well considering the circumstances and are by far the best part of this film.However, much like most films in the MCU this suffers from trying to do too much at once and emotional beats are undercut by jokes or action. As always the real villain here is colonialism. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  I absolutely loved this. Ryan Coogler took an impossible task and delivered a thoughtful, funny, and epic blockbuster. This is what I’ve been missing from Marvel lately. It has tangential connections to the overarching MCU narrative but it’s mostly a self-sustained sequel that manages to build on the world Coogler built in the first movie and also work in the real life grief of losing its star Chadwick Boseman. I thought it was wonderfully executed. Visually this may be my…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; Junge ey... was ne Shitshow.Nennt mir nur einen Namen eines Characters aus diesem Film, außer den von Jamie Lee Curtis und Michael Myers. Ihr könnt es nicht. Warum? WEIL NIEMANDEN DIESE LANGWEILIGE AMATEURHAFTE SCHEISSE INTERESSIERT!

Pearl 2022;8; X: lots of raw-doggingPearl: lots of straw-dogging 
Get Out 2017;8;  First time seeing it since the theatre in 2017 and I have to admit, this is astonishing and far from the basic white liberal satire that I feared I'd discover on rewatch. Far from a "liberal for it's time" Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, this thing is genuinely provocative and the only thing ironic about it is that I don't think you'd be able to get away with this in 2022. More than just clever - Peele only employs genre…  
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  I went into this picture with great hopes and very big expectations largely due to the positive critical reception and since the first installment was still vivid in my mind.Although none of the deaths top the "split scene," the most memorable and horrifying death in the horror genre, the film nevertheless manages to deliver effective gore and kills, some of which were so graphic I had to look away. In particular, I love the "stab stab little pal" scene…  
The Conjuring 2013;8;  <ENGLISH VERSION BELOW>Das Verderben schreitet voran. Vorbei am Truchsess repetitiven Scheiterns, entlang den düsteren Gängen aus bedauernden Klägern und angekommen im Lärm einer sanften Umgebung. Was sieht es da?The Conjuring tritt im Gewand klassischer Horrorhaus-Geschichten vor, aber benötigt keine Scheu. Stattdessen nutzt der Film vorangegangenes um die Inszenierung zum primären Punkt kandidieren zu lassen. Innerhalb dieser Prämisse kann der Horror-Aspekt des Films auf ganzer Linie überzeugen.Die Frage nach Relevanz bleibt zu Beginn offen. Eine weitere Erzählung des…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; Anyone who has watched the slew of modern music biopics, some of which are better than others, has probably become tired of their well-worn structure and inevitable clichés. That is why it is so satisfying to see them lampooned with such delirious energy and sense of silly irreverence. As far as parodies go, I prefer Dewey Cox, the humour of which just caters more towards my taste, but this is definitely a fun time. The film would really benefit from being seen with an audience, though I find myself making that point a lot at the moment. 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;10; oh boy did i fall even more in love with henry cavill. perfection, give me all the enola stories please!

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On 2021;10; are you fucking kidding me 
The Witch 2015;10; film lovin’ me: this is a brilliant portrait of paranoia and religious fervor in the 1600s. it’s so inpressive how eggers manages to capture the spirit of the time without feeling like he’s painstakingly trying to pull an unnatural sense of tension or a period-accurate performance out of his actorsthe real me: motherfuckers need to TALK NORMAL!!!! stop sayin THOUST!!!!!!!!!! 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8; “let her have her podcast!”the director called it lord of the flies meets mean girls and im obsessed with that. a HOOT! 
Armageddon Time 2022;4;  Some movies are less than their best intentions. It’s difficult to fully parse writer/director James Gray’s white guilt manifesto Armageddon Time, his follow-up to his sad-dad opus Ad Astra, without falling under its well-meaning spell. But we’ve seen this movie before, the one where a white person learns about racism to the detriment of their Black counterpart. In this case, the familiar narrative takes place in 1980, in a corner of Gray’s childhood neighborhood in Queens. Serving as Gray’s autobiographical…  
Pearl 2022;10; Per-fei-toTão doce, tão feminino e absurdamente realista. “Pearl” é uma obra prima, representa a vida de toda menina que cresce querendo ser famosa e sonha em conquistar o mundo. O modo como a personagem principal lida com suas frustrações e a necessidade que ela tem de abrir mão dos segredos mais íntimos, é encantador. Uma jovem forte que fará o que for preciso para obter o que quer. Me identifiquei do início ao fim, andava sentindo falta de filmes que tocam a alma! 
Barbarian 2022;8;  The progression of horror towards only the sleekest, most up-to-date aesthetics, towards neutral-grey minimalism and smudgeless iPhones, has met its match with the Airbnb. Where the harsh cabin lighting of dirt cheap genre films of the past served as an in-world justification for low resources and messy filmmaking, so too does the Airbnb here serve as a “justification” for (and more-so a diatribe against) the liminal, uber-expensive yet fundamentally empty worlds the genre loves to occupy now.It becomes sort…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4; Touching tribute to Boseman at the beginning, but the rest of this is just more of the same. Dull action, blank slate villain, forced humor, subplots galore, and a bloated and unjustified runtime, all packaged and repurposed until it swallows up any attempts at genuine pathos. Everyone involved is so talented that this is just sad more than anything — and I don’t even fault anyone who actually made the film. Not that Marvel hasn’t produced duds before, but man is this post Endgame streak of films and shows almost uniformly dire. Best thing about this one is that incredible first trailer. GRADE: C 
The Fabelmans 2022;10;  The Fabelmans has a heart as big as Steven Spielberg’s most beloved blockbusters, making you fall in love with the movies all over again. Michelle Williams is the cast standout, and a true wonder who suffuses the story with soul - a story that is specific and universal, simultaneously. Spielberg’s speciality.The first half is a ton of fun, taking you back to the moment you first felt the magic of film, but the second half SOARS, digging deeper into…  
Slumberland 2022;8;  Slumberland is a fun and fanciful family fantasy with a heartfelt emotional core. Marlow Barkley stars as Nemo who’s father (KyleChandler) has tragically passed away, with only her estranged uncle Phillip (Chris O’Dowd) left to raise her. Desperate to see her father again, even if only in dreams, in Slumberland she befriends an outlaw thief (Jason Momoa) and together they traverse varying dreamscapes in search of a fabled treasure thought to grant wishes. Momoa very nearly goes full Jack Sparrow in this swashbuckling…

Triangle of Sadness 2022;10;  Jermaine works in security in the marble lobby of this huge building with a screening room in Beverly Hills. It's on Rodeo Drive, so it was all designer clothing stores crosswalk to crosswalk. I asked him if the mens room was down the hall and he said “yeah, I’ll have to let you in”.

Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Scream ‘22, so full of Star Wars discourse, saw what was coming for David Gordon Green’s Halloween trilogy: an entertaining but uninspired first entry, a wonderfully audacious second installment that gave no fucks about ticking boxes, and a third film that even hardcore fans will likely avoid discussing. No, there isn’t a Force dyad bonding babysitter with boogeyman, but what transpires makes roughly the same amount of sense. For those who worried Halloween Ends would be much too much of…

The Handmaiden 2016;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  lesbians scamming men and staying together is my favorite film genre  
Beijing Bicycle 2001;8;  In many ways an incredibly frustrating film in that the person responsible for the central conflict is never seen nor acknowledged, two others have to suffer the consequences and make the best of an unjust situation without confronting their wrongdoer because there is simply nothing to be done, nothing they can do. Yet, it is this invisibility that reinforces the many individual grievances found everywhere, in everyone, the complete disregard of the bicycle thief almost justified because everyone else screws…  
BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;10;  “La memoria carece de verdad, solo tiene coherencia emocional.”What is identity if not the collection of our memories? What is life if not the strange journey that shapes it?It’s fascinating how we are all victims of circumstance in a way, how perhaps we wouldn’t be the people we are if we had made one single different choice.We are the product of what was, what is, what could have been - Alejandro González Iñárritu understands that better than…

Creature from the Black Lagoon 1954;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I like in old movies when the monster dies and the movie just immediately ends. There are so many plot lines here that could’ve been wrapped up in an epilogue and make for a richer movie, but nope, The End. It’s weirdly charming, scary go bye and now movie go bye!  
Barbarian 2022;8; Can totally relate to this. Putting yourself out there and meeting new people can be super hard, let alone meeting people you actually legitimately like enough to descend into their basement rape dungeon. 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8;  After hearing so much about this film, I was finally able to watch it, and it lived up to every expectation.Even though the jokes and dialogues became cringe-worthy at the end, I thought everyone in the cast did a fine job. The mystery and the reveal are so apparent, but they nevertheless managed to throw me for a loop and make me giggle uncontrollably, I found the punch of irony to be really satisfying. The soundtrack is excellent, and…

Score: A Film Music Documentary 2016;8;  Far from being the most comprehensive documentary on the role of music in film, that honor goes to another one that I can't remember now that goes decade by decade following the evolution of music up to the modern era.That is not to imply that the documentary isn't interesting, in fact, it highlights not just the composers' work, but also the crew behind the music and supporting the film composer, from the orchestra to the editors and sound mixers.…  
Born to Kill 1947;8;  Hollywood was so scared to death by a woman’s agency, it spent a decade after her arrival trying to conjure up tough guys to make anyone forget she ever existed. Robert Wise’s “Born to Kill” so shocked on its release in cinemas, it was almost immediately banned from heartland American theatres, causing studio RKO to disown its noir problem child just days after its birth. After being placed on a Production Code blacklist for overly salacious crime pictures, “Kill” further…  
Frenzy 1972;10;  Hitchcock’s darkest film? Visually it’s his most transgressive and it’s representation of society as a subliminal matriarchal framework that is being penetrated by a murderous rapist may go too far. Some fascinating characters including a lead role that’s more Oliver Reed than Oliver Reed pitted against one of cinemas most nefarious villains. It’s a revamp of Jack The Ripper for modern tastes (& distaste)  with Hitchcock literally flying back into London in the opening title sequence. London a rough place…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Thank you Ryan Coogler and Marvel for NOT using CGI to bring back Chadwick. I had fears they would do that when Shuri went to the Ancestral Plane. It would've been disrespectful, idc what anyone says.Using scenes of him in the ending were much more emotionally impactful. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; It would be an understatement to say that Black Panther the name is a staple in film, pop culture and the black community. With the unfortunate circumstances of our beloved king Chadwick, Ryan had the unbelievabe task of delivery a satisfying sequel to a blockbuster classic and I think he succeeded for the most part. Beautiful movie, beautiful people, beautiful cultures. My heart glowed as an heart shaped herb. Long live Wakanda Forever 
Breathless 1960;10;  Made a spur-of-the-moment decision to go see this for the umpteenth time at a nearby repertory cinema. Letterboxd says my last viewing was in 2017, which is actually a pretty long time ago. There are certain movies that I think it’s good to see at least once every five years, like visiting the doctor for a check-up.A cliché thing to say about this would be, “Imagine what it would have been like to see this in 1960!” But fuck,…  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;6; more like the School for Gays and Elesbians 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Is there value in being nice? The Banshees of Inisherin is a film of inexplicable decisions by lonely souls. Two men, on the same island, caught in a needless fight, a representation of the civil war which exists as a backdrop to the story. Kindness is a virtue, but it doesn't last. Men contemplate legacy, wanting to achieve things that will last. The Banshees of Inisherin becomes a series of a tragedies, as a nice man is pushed until he…

Bros 2022;6;  This movie is so hard to review because I'm struggling to decide how much I should let my enjoyment affect my rating. I genuinely had a good time and laughed quite a bit whenever I wasn't rolling my eyes or heavily sighing. This movie dares to ask the question, "what if annoying gay people got laid too," and while I admire the gusto, I do have to wonder the love story this could've been if Billy Eichner didn't hate himself…  
Barbarian 2022;8;  holy shit. easily one of the most bizarre, comedic and delightfully absurd little horror films to be shown in theaters in some time—which makes this a huge breath of fresh air—but going in completely blind is the way to go. while this may tackle too many elements at once, with one crazy abrupt tonal shift midway which caught me off guard, it effectively uses the element of surprise to its benefit, someone in the theater legitimately screamed her head off…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2;  The film is earnest with its elegiac and commemorative meditations, but much of the imagery and discourse is tethered to blockbuster and franchise demands: fan service, pop-culture iconography, intellectual property, weightless action, palatable storytelling, and a soullessly uniform aesthetic hold the film back from achieving something inspiring. I also cannot take the politics of the MCU seriously, especially when their films try to make purportedly grand or meaningful statements about the legacies of colonial exploitation or imperialism yet only settle…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Given that it's way past my bedtime, here are some kinda rushed, scattered thoughts:🔥 Wakanda Forever is a magical, visually majestic, emotionally resonating, and unapologetically Black cinematic experience. Here, Coogler blesses us with a superb blend of humor, pathos, thrills, adventure, and spectacle. 🔥 I love how Wakanda Forever isn't just Black centered, it's Black Women Centered. I'm 100% here for badass Black women warriors and badass Black women in positions of power running shit!🔥 I'm in love…

Scream 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   God damn, I wanted to hang myself during the "meta" scenes where the characters oh-so-cleverly talk about legacy sequels. This movie acts like it's hitting on a really original insight by pointing out that many franchise revivals bring together veterans and newer stars. Yes, I'm aware of this, I've been to the movies in the last decade. The satire is toothless, going after message-board dwellers and "toxic fandom" while remaining vague about how, exactly, these fan circles are toxic (since…

All That Jazz 1979;10; the best movie about showbiz possibly ever?? 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; A monumental and almost impossible task was given to Ryan Coogler and this crew, they had to somehow overcome an immeasurable loss while simultaneously making a sequel to one of the most successful and beloved films of the past decade. It’s bloated and quite messy but I think this crew pulled it off and put together a pretty great film. Bravo. 
The Sixth Sense 1999;8;  ✅85%Bruce Willis Ranked list - HERE"Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see.

It's a perfect mix of mystery, drama and a few horror elements. And what more could you want than to see Bruce Willis at his…  
The Magnificent Ambersons 1942;6;  This film came out one year after Citizen Kane and Welles believed himself that this would've been the better film if the studio didn't take the final cut away from him. Many people (the majority) believe this to still be a great movie. I found it a bit hard to fully get emerged into the story. There are peaks and valleys in this one for me, but I can definitely see the bones of a great work by Welles that…  
Terrifier 2 2022;6;  If there’s one thing I find fascinating about Terrifier 2, its not so much the gratuity but how audiences have received the movie. Do we ignore things like stale characters, bad performances, bloated runtimes and inane dialogue simply because a film is willing to push the boundaries of gore? I’m not so sure, maybe? Undoubtedly Terrifier 2 reaches new heights in its senseless violence and the practical effects are sickeningly good. At a certain point the violence is so vicious…  
Hereditary 2018;8; Ari Aster has my number. His movies fill me with genuine dread like no other horror director really ever has. Something about the plodding intensity with which he advances towards a horrific inevitability. He locks you in early, and there's no escaping. Catching this late, just rewatch Midsommar for the 3rd time, and I definitely prefer that one. I know some people will disagree, but this one ultimately feels more trope-heavy than Midsommar, and I find Midsommar's third act much harder hitting. 
Terrifier 2 2022;4; It has its moments that I’m sure some will enjoy, however, who allowed this film to be 138 minutes long? 
My Policeman 2022;8; Really surprised by this! David Dawson is amazing but also thought Emma Corrin did a great job and Harry Styles certainly did his best (often good!). Love how much it loves the art world (lots of “this frame’s a painting!”), and thought the storyline, the push and pull of it all, was complex and well-handled. Good!

Barbarian 2022;8;  What. A. Ride.In a world inundated with so much stale horror, at least on the mainstream front, Barbarian is welcomed breath of fresh air. It is chaos incarnate and it’s sheer unpredictability is why it stands tall over so many of the horror films from this year. When you think it will zig, it zags and it all culminates to a jaw-dropping climax. Hilarious at some moments and traumatizing at others, the reverberation of laughter and screams in a…  
Obi-Wan Kenobi 2022;6;  This review is for The Patterson CutSo believe it or not, this was my first watch of a fan edit for any film or show ever. And I must say I’m surprised, and it goes to show the power and significance of editing on the filmmaking process.In many ways, this fan edit cut of of the Disney+ series based iconic Jedi is superior to the original show.

Armageddon Time 2022;10;  Expectation enacts a violence on children that only draws more spiritual blood when suffered with blows dealt from the weapon of privilege. James Gray’s “Armageddon Time” has one of the most unexpected jump scares in cinema this season, a sudden appearance by Fred Trump, father of the one-day U.S President. Taking the podium at a prestigious prep school, he gives a speech assuring its khaki uniform-wearing prodigies of power that they will one day run the world. Like the long…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Was expecting to hate this based on early word from friends. Imagine my surprise when i pretty much loved it.As someone who hasn't really given a shit about the "Strode Legacy" arc or whatever these last two films have been all about, this one felt like a breath of fresh air. No slavish recreations of shots from the original (more or less), no grafting importance onto bit players from previous films. Felt more like an addendum or epilogue to whatever story got wrapped up in Kills, but i don't care. I gotta respect a bold swing like this. 
Spirited Away 2001;10; I got lost in a department store when I was 5 and it felt a lot like this 
Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid 1973;10;  A melancholic reverie about how everything ends, and everyone is only free enough to die told by the point of view of a bastard who is damned to keep living. Every gut shot counts, and every lovely photographed western character actor is already a ghost. Movie image is sort of death in process anyway might as well make a movie that feels like a bunch of reaction shots to it. For some reason Bob Dylan is around to serenade as…  
Thor: Love and Thunder 2022;6; Marvel Ranked2022 RankedCan’t lie, I fell asleep for a bit. Christian Bale was excellent and seemed in a different film to everyone else. The comedy fell completely flat, think I laughed once maybe twice. The ending was cute though but Marvel need something to wake itself and me up.

The King of Comedy 1982;10;  Arthur Fleck ain’t got nothing on Rupert Pupkin. It’s hard not to draw the parallels between Joker and this Martin Scorsese masterpiece. But for those of you that haven’t seen this film, you are truly missing out on something special. Without giving away too much, Rupert Pupkin is obsessed with late night talk show host Jerry Langford and misinterprets a chance meeting as an open door for his big break. What transpires is a series of delusional made-up scenarios and…

Aftersun 2022;8;  Paul Mescal is Daddy. And, we couldn’t be luckier as filmgoers that he has chosen to take on the parental responsibility. There’s a tendency of the most prodigious young actors to often pick roles of an emotional age beyond their own experience. Jennifer Lawrence being a much lauded recent example, this group of artists doesn’t outstay their teen years welcome, but rises to the challenge of meeting pathos with a performance that pushes them to, or beyond, their own years. …

Hellbound: Hellraiser II 1988;6;  They did go to hell. But, to be honest, I'd rather see Pinhead and the Cenobites get more screen time. They are the real reason why this franchise has grown in popularity. Despite its arguably more ambitious plot and accompanying aesthetics, it's simply a more straightforward story and, as a result, isn't as engaging as its predecessor. It was also far stranger than the first. It wasn't much sadomasochistic stuff, just strange stuff. Don't misunderstand me. I usually like weird,…

Now that it's out wide, I can say — while TÁR goes hard — I didn't want to go too hard on her in my initial review out of Venice. Many critics forget that we walked into the screening with only a teaser of Cate Blanchett blowing smoke while some lines from the movie (and brief images from the movie that weren't even in it) were overlayed. The movie doesn't say "cancel culture," "#MeToo," or "identity politics" or any of…   
Wendell & Wild 2022;4; loathe to give any stop-motion a negative review - especially selick’s first film since one of my favorites - because they’re all nothing short of miracles but hoo boy this thing just doesn’t work - a painfully jumbled mess of half-baked ideas and characters, some of which flicker with brief moments of spirited inspiration that hint at what a more focused (and much, much shorter) version of this could be, but most of which fall flat on their face before they can even attempt to get off the ground 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; This was bad, but so hysterical that at least I got a bunch of laughs out of it. The actors were good (especially Jamie Lee Curtis and Andi Matichak), but hopefully this film is the final nail in the coffin for the series. Vegan alert:Meats and lots of killing peopleWatched on: Peacock

Amsterdam 2022;8;  “This is gorgeous. Just look at it.”-Burt-Amsterdam is a rustic, meticulously crafted film highlighting the forgotten artistry found in masterful story telling. Amsterdam is woefully underrated and undervalued as this is one of the best examples of what is missing in cinema today. From its rich history and colorful characters, to its hushed humor and well written screenplay, Amsterdam should be a destination we all aspire to visit. It’s truly gorgeous, just look at it. David O.

The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970;6; Argento is a great director however he has a habit of working piss poor scripts. His vivid style and choice of music gets pulped from his films hacked structure and lack of sophistication.Much like the film Phenomena this film it starts brilliantly then bleeds out into goofy nonsense. 
Barbarian 2022;8;  A roller-coaster ride of tension, thriller, and horror that I never saw coming.The director, Zach Cregger, destabilizes the audience in subtle ways. Though he does not reinvent the horror genre, he has a lot of fun twisting things, upsetting expectations, and keeping audiences on the edge of their seats - at least until the film begins to build to a climax. The cast is small, but the actors are acutely aware of the game they must play, concealing their…

Love the immensely rich visuals and the cryptic storytelling. Definitely not a great family watch.

Rather, the characters are captured and escape smugglers within the tropical setting, a sub-genre known as "Jungle Prison".

Causeway 2022;8;  It's truly gratifying to see Jennifer Lawrence strip down to the indie girl that she was, in Lila Neugebauer's strong directorial debut. It's not the most inspired story of the subgenre, but the tender, melancholic quality it possesses is charming enough on its own.As a character study, Causeway excels at depicting broken people at their most vulnerable. A traumatized soldier and an amputee form a beautiful connection via their shared pain in a gloomy New Orleans, and the chemistry…

Sadly this didn’t get a uk release on the cinema till Friday but after waiting over a month i had to watch it and it was incredible. From the start…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN — god damn — that is a tightly written film from Martin McDonagh. Colin Farrell is so funny, and so tragic and achingly vulnerable. Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan are also brilliant in this emotionally rich, existential film.So many scenes are bouncing around in my head. There isn't one moment that doesn't strikingly lead to another: whether it's a sharp punchline or a devastating revelation. It's funny until it's not. And when it's not funny, it's poetic in its economic translation of depression. 
Perfect Blue 1997;10; there’s a lot to unpack here, probably gonna be thinking about this one for a while. visually it’s absolutely gorgeous. 
Pearl 2022;8; i will watch any horror movie with mia goth in it 
Barbarian 2022;8; Bill Skarsgård’s character says “Do I look like some kind of monster?” like he doesn’t also play Pennywise. 
Malignant 2021;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  great addition to the “‘where is my mind’ by the pixies in a movie where two people end up being one person” cinematic universe  
Megamind 2010;10; megamind > the godfatherdelete your account if you don't agree 
Armageddon Time 2022;6;  Featuring a tremendous cast that includes Sir Anthony Hopkins, Anne Hathaway and Jeremy Strong and Jessica Chastain (albeit more of a cameo), I actually think Banks Repeta and Jaylin Webb steal the show with their on screen friendship. Though it’s central themes repeatedly touch on race, class, privilege and the pursuit of the American dream, it never really feels like it’s exploring these topics in a deep or meaningful way.  As a result, when the credits rolled I felt a…  
The Watcher 2022;4; defund ryan murphy 
Watcher 2022;6; not really doing anything new here narratively with the gaslight/voyeur thriller but maika is so good at being vulnerable and terrified she carries it through the duller, more predictable slowburn stretches. and honestly pretty impressive direction for a debut, with lots of eerie subjective mood and some pretty well-conceived paranoid stalker suspense imagery. 
Dog Day Afternoon 1975;10; be bisexual, do crime 
X 2022;8; free my girl she did nothing wrong her only crime was being horny 
Knives Out 2019;8; A movie as good as its sweaters (the sweaters are excellent) 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; Michael Myers is OUT. Art the Clown is IN 
Rosaline 2022;8; this is what Shakespeare would have wanted <3 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Could have been weirder and could have been way shorter, but definitely funny in parts. I kind of feel like Eat The Rich is a very easy satire at this point and it’s very funny to have been laughing at/with this in Cannes but hey whatever!!! Cinema!!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2;  A complete mess, bursting at the seams with wasted time and pointless nothing. The single most incomprehensible and nonsensical plot any one of these has had, which is saying a lot. You have never seen a movie's central conflict be so hackneyed, tangential, pointless, overwrought, inscrutable, and plain stupid. Wheel-spinningly bizarre in its approach to Wakanda as a global superpower and place, especially after the ending to the first. A few good scenes (opening boat/scuba diver attack scene is great,…  
Barbarian 2022;8; the girl in the beginning was a massive dumbass, but God DAMN this movie was wild 
The Menu 2022;2;  „Du bist der Grund, weshalb diese Kunst zugrunde geht“, sagt Ralph Fiennes und im Hintergrund kann man beinahe die Drehbuchautoren hören, wie sie sich zufrieden auf die Schultern klopfen, weil - jetzt guckt doch mal wie clever das alles ist, was wir hier geschrieben haben!! „The Menu“ ist Satire von und für Psychologiestudenten im ersten Semester, die glauben, die Natur des Menschen entschlüsselt zu haben, weil im Schrank das gesammelte Werk von Erich Fromm und Heinz Kohut auf die Rückgabe in…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;6;  much respect for initiating such a project. a period piece set in a remote, secluded and close-to-abstract world of an 1923 irish island. a lot could have gone wrong and i'm not sure if some stuff actually went off the rails - can you depict these folks without making it into a slapstick show? how would an earnest approach look like? could that work (and wouldn't this be the much bigger challenge)?gotta take it as fairy tale and allegory…  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;8; very cute, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time!! sofia wylie u will always be famous! 
Set It Up 2018;8; fine, straights... you win this time 
10 Things I Hate About You 1999;10; the moral of the story is that all men are evil except heath ledger and joseph gordon-levitt and honestly BIG MOOD! 
Good Will Hunting 1997;10; will never be able to wrap my head around the fact that matt damon and ben affleck wrote this screenplay they literally look like they have one brain cell between the two of them 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  The moment of silence during the Marvel Studios logo will go down as one of the great moments of this cinematic universe. Chadwick Boseman Forever!Black Panther: Wakanda Forever brings the rollercoaster that was Phase 4 to a close. Mediocre to say the least, it’s nice to see them end in a positive note. What represents a loving tribute to Chadwick Boseman but also a continuation of the people of Wakanda as they find themselves up against a new and…  
Phenomena 1985;8;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest Hangover 2022)🎃Well that was an awfully buggy version of 'Suspiria'."The Bible also refers to the devil as Beelzebub, which means 'Lord of the Flies.' Look at her - the Lady of the Flies."A young girl finds herself in a not-so-welcoming private school for girls in a foreign country, and then ends up getting entangled with a series of murders. The master of giallos Director Dario Argento sure does seem to enjoy working around these…  
Isle of Dogs 2018;8;  Com um design lindo, uma fotografia exuberante e uma história de cunho político e social mas com alguns toques de humor, a ilha dos cachorros de Wes Anderson diverte, cativa e traz reflexões sobre nossa sociedade.Na trama, cachorros são portadores de um vírus capaz de infectar humanos, e diante dessa situação, o governo autoritário de uma cidade situada num Japão distópico, decide isolar todos os cães para morrerem numa ilha repleta de lixo, sem água e comida, o que…  
Taste of Cherry 1997;10;  Kiarostami is right. Life is hard. I don't need to know why this guy wants to kill himself, I understand. That said, I hope he doesn't do it.I like that the guy who advocates most forcefully for Badii to stay alive is also the one who agrees to help him with his suicide. He needs the money to help his ailing daughter. He's the oldest of the passengers, and has accumulated the life experience to talk to Badii, but…  
My Policeman 2022;2; Queerbaiters shouldn’t be acclaimed for playing gay characters. Especially when they’re disrespecting queer cinema and queer representation as a whole in interviews. I’m sure the straight mlm fetishizers will love this tho🙏🏾

Dreams in the Witch House 2022;2; Lovecraptian horror. (2)From the visionary director of Twilight comes Inside Ron Weasley: Scabbers' Revenge. 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;4;  Fairy tales are typically simple and evocative pieces of folklore that tend to communicate lucid moral lessons through the power of story. Paul Feig’s star-studded “The School for Good and Evil” — which is pretty much just “Harry Potter” recast with princesses, fairies, and a random assortment of literary characters from the public domain — might be the most aggressively convoluted YA movie I’ve ever seen. In the world of “Miss Peregrine” and “Mortal Instruments,” this thing is practically “The…

Halloween Ends 2022;10; Yeah I just sat my ass down to watch the entire film again at home, and I really fucking like it. So many things that could have and should have been different to appeal to the expectations, but it totally does not care and exists as its own entity. Hope this gets the reappraisal that Season of the Witch and for whatever fucking reason Zombie's Halloween II currently has. Good shit.INITIAL REVIEW 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  given everything that happened behind the scenes it’s kind of a miracle that this is at all watchable, let alone pretty good, and a complete testament to Ryan Coogler’s skills as a filmmaker that he was able to make this work for as often as it does. that being said i don’t blame him for how messy this is, i wish one of these goddamn movies could go without setup for the next thing, but the moments here where the…  
Causeway 2022;8; So understated. Verging on a little too slow for me at times. Great performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry. An honest look at the effects of trauma. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Iron Man. That is accepted as fact and disputed by none. His sarcastic wit and dry delivery made him an instant icon when he first donned the red metallic suit in 2008. The same could be said for Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, although for different reasons. Boseman burst into the MCU in Captain America: Civil War, a movie that features an all star cast of established characters, yet, Black Panther not only stood…  
Causeway 2022;8;  I promise you all I am doing my best to catch up on a lot of new releases I am behind on. Life… Jennifer Lawrence is my new front runner for the Oscar for Best Actress. She is better than ever in this movie, giving us an absolutely heartbreaking and emotional display of acting excellence. She is so god damn good. I wish I was that good at literally anything in my life. Above all, this movie is a fucking…  
Before Midnight 2013;10;  —I am giving you my whole life ok? I got nothing larger to give, I'm not giving it to anybody else. If you're looking for permission to disqualify me, I'm not gonna give it to you. Ok? I love you. And I'm not in conflict about it. Okay? But if what you want is like a laundry list of all the things that piss me off, I can give it to you.I don't think I've ever been this invested…  
Barbarian 2022;8; the most fucked up airbnb ad i’ve ever seen 
Men 2022;4; heyyy queen i saw your tweet about how men are trash and i just wanted to let you know that i agree. although i myself am a man, (i know, ugh) i am on your side. “one of the good ones” as some may say, 
Morbius 2022;2; jared leto is like king midas except everything he touches turns to shit 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;8; imagine how awkward that drive home must’ve been 
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;8; You may see it as a story of teenagers being dismembered by a chain saw killer but I see it as a like minded family trying to give their ailing grandfather one last shot to do the thing he loves best ❤️ 
Carrie 1976;8; matilda took a dark turn 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;4;  The School of Good and Evil is obviously set up to be one of Netflix’s next big franchises, it’s an exposition-heavy two and a half hours of set-up, intended to lay the foundations for the inevitable sequels, yet it never finds time to tell a compelling story through its simplistic narrative with the entire plot feeling predictable from the get go. Sadly, it stumbles right out the gate with a mediocre story, uninteresting characters and a runtime that makes it…  
Dark Glasses 2022;10;  Even I, surely his greatest disciple, was cautiously optimistic about this movie, but I’m beyond pleased to say that it is a beautiful return to form for our lord and savior, Dario Argento!A blind prostitute and an orphaned Asian boy team up against a black gloved killer which is certainly an original approach to a traditional giallo storyline, although even that isn’t as traditional as it sounds. The first half definitely reminds me of his old school giallo before…  
The Munsters 2022;4; Like watching a porn parody without the sex. 
Knives Out 2019;8; Hannah Baker hits the Juul not even 5 minutes in 
Interview with the Vampire 1994;6; nothing about this makes sense.... is this a romance? a comedy? a horror film?how was this so gay? but how was it not gayer? how was this marketed? who funded this? how was this made?whooooooo saw this in theaters? where are they now?why did kirsten dunst have to snap so hard? why was tom cruise given the go ahead by scientology to make this extremely erotic film? why did the audience not clap after antonio banderas' extremely thought-provoking play? why is this dedicated to river phoenix?is brad pitt... like... okay?and last but not least.. where is the sequel!?!??!?! 
The Double Life of Véronique 1991;8; beautiful but i have no idea what the fuck happened 
Anatomy of a Murder 1959;10;  Anatomy of a Murder. 1959. Directed by Otto Preminger.Anatomy of a Murder (1959) is arguably one of the finest court room procedural dramas of the time with its noir tinged moments of history well displayed. Wendell Mayes screenplay based on John D. Voelker’s eponymous novel is a fine film with James Stewart as Paul Biegler, Lee Remick as Laura Manion, and Ben Gazzara (Lt. Frederick Manion). Attorney Biegler is in partial retirement with his mind mostly on fishing and…

Pulp Fiction 1994;8; does quentin tarantino think that a screenplay automatically gets better every time a white person says the n word 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; Terrifer 2 is for perverts who like their horror to come from the back of a 80’s video store. I am said pervert. 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  A more or less complete misguided swing for the fences that is pretty ridiculous, but easy to find some sympathy for. The overall concept on this one is a very dumb attempt to suggest how a depressed resentful place births evil, of using some recognizable horror tropes and the bluntness the genre is often known for and transmute them into an allegory about how “deep American went bad”. The way it gets around to it is often silly and because…  
The Shining 1980;10;  Kubrick:  Rewinding and Reevaluating ~ Part 3"Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I’ve tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice." ~ Robert Frost, "Fire and Ice"A novel swallowed up in Fire. A film consumed by Ice. What is arguably Stephen King's…  
Kill Bill: Vol. 1 2003;10; tarantino’s casting call for this like “bad bitches only 😡🧍🏻‍♀️🚫” 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Ryan Coogler was given the daunting task of eulogising the franchise’s original star while maintaining the extravagant trappings the audience has come to expect from the MCU. Wakanda Forever is being judged on how delicately it addresses this tragic loss, and from that perspective, Coogler’s work is certainly worthy of praise. While the film is structurally uneven, presents an aesthetically bland underwater world and is undeniably overlong, it is most importantly a heartfelt tribute to a wonderful talent. 
The Chronicles of Riddick 2004;10; it's like fritz lang directed a mountain dew commercial 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  ENGLISCH untenR.I.P. Marvel Phase IV Ruhe in Frieden, Marvel Phase IV, ich werde dich NICHT vermissen. "Wakanda Forever" beginnt mit einer kraftvollen und erschütternden Sequenz, die den Verlust von Chadwick Boseman auf geschmackvolle und angemessene Weise betrauert.Danach beginnt der eigentliche Film und wird ziemlich schnell sehr gewöhnlich. Soweit ich mich erinnere, war das MCU noch nie langweiliger, vor allem visuell. Die Cinematographie ist nichts Besonderes und schon gar nicht, wenn man bedenkt, dass wir hier eine neue und…  
The Edge 1997;8; I really am a sucker for these wilderness survival movies. This was no exception. The setting was stunning. Plenty of gripping thrills. I loved Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins as the leads. It dragged on a bit by the end but overall a lot of fun. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  Adapted from the 1929 novel of Erich Maria Remarque, Edward Berger’s All Quiet on the Western Front is a relentless, volatile film adaptation that distills the essence of Remarque’s text: war is futile. It’s worth noting that this is the second film adaptation of the same novel, after 1930 version with Lewis Milestone directing (an American film production)—which I have not seen yet. This time however, the film is all mounted by full German production which makes it more distinctive…  
36 2012;8;  Ruminates on the whole "is it better to take a picture of something or appreciate it in the moment" which, frankly, is kind of a bullshit 'gotcha' ultimatum that I never really liked as if you can only do one or the other with zero nuance involved.Thankfully the film itself does offer some nuance on this topic and explores a much wider scope, namely the relation between memory and mementos (in this case photographs) as well as the relative…  
Crimes of the Future 2022;6; The Future has lots of Crime,But Viggo is still in his prime.Cause in the future,He likes to suture,And does it, like, all of the time. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6;  Although I'm not usually one to believe such wild theories, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people who are so harsh on Harry Style are just Swift or One Direction detractors. Sure, he's no thespian, and in many ways, he never fit into this role, but many people have been lately going around saying he was worse or on par with Tommy Wiseau. Like, seriously?Aside from that, the film is average. There are some excellent ideas, many of…  
Pearl 2022;10; i've never wanted to be a scarecrow so bad 
Resurrection 2022;6; 57Maybe not the best movie to watch if you're already anxious. This had me feeling nervous as fuck. Director Andrew Semans provides a sharp, unsettling tone to mysterious character dynamics. Rebecca Hall, Tim Roth, and Grace Kaufman do their best to elevate a repetitive and unwieldy narrative, and they mostly succeed. An excellent trio of performances. 
Kantara 2022;8; Man o Man.. Rishabh Shetty simply nails it, delivering a fascinating mix of myth n masala. If his writing-direction was terrific, he takes the game a further notch up with his show stealing thunderous performance. The narrative seamlessly blends mythological folklore and rooted native culture, absorbing one straightaway into its world and keeping engaged all through. Amping up the excitement even more are it’s spectacular action sequences, visuals and soundtrack. It raises intensity during the pre climax and wraps things up with goosebump loaded final few minutes, making it one hell of a big screen theatrical experience. Highly recommended.

Midsommar 2019;10; and you're telling me that thesis should still be an academic requirement? 
The Dark Corner 1946;8;  Like a great dame’s curves, “The Dark Corner” has shadows in all the right places. There should be little surprise the dark figures of “Corner” have such poeticism in their menace. The film’s cinematographer is Joseph MacDonald, also behind the immortal visual language of “My Darling Clementine.” And, “Corner’s” director is Henry Hathaway, best known for his essential Westerns like “Rawhide” and “True Grit.” The two make a dichotomy of light and dark, creating definitive images of stark contrast that…  
Oldboy 2003;10;  Oldboy. 2003. Directed by Park Chan-wook.Five star films are difficult to find and Oldboy (2003) is a masterpiece that parallels Quentin Tarantino stylized films filled with violence. In fact, Quentin Tarantino was the president of the jury at Cannes Film Festival in 2004 when Oldboy won the Grand Prix. Park Chan-wook, in our opinion, has established himself as Korea’s Tarantinoesque director with more versatility with regard to storytelling. His films are filled with perfect sets, dazzling wipes, creative dialed…

Before Sunset 2004;10; What are you doing to me, Linklater???I don't even like romance, and this is two all-timers in a row for me. What is happening? Who am I??To be honest, I WAS a little worried at first because I wasn't sure where this was going. But then the second half of this movie came in to knock the wind out of me. The car scene alone, MY GOD.P.S. Why the hell did it take me this long to finally watch this trilogy?

What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution? 1972;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciWell, apparently as far as Corbucci is concerned, if the films have a roughly similar premise or setting, the reasoning is very likely that they belong to a trilogy. This apparently serves as the final installment of a trilogy that comprises The Mercenary and Companeros, which explains the seeming recycling of the premise between these two films.As far as entries go, the film is far from the best,…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Wakanda Forever surprisingly ends up faring better than its predecessor, and it's the strongest Phase 4 movie (Loki is still the best P4 project as a whole). Coogler balances making a sequel and a touching tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman efficiently.It has its moments of humour, and to a fault, it gets a bit overstuffed with the MCU-isms of new characters and subplots, but the film is mostly somber and mature, which is REALLY FUCKING REFRESHING, with the…  
Decision to Leave 2022;8; American audiences better turn out for this because it’s so much more of a Night At The Movies than most mainstream thrillers, even good ones, can manage. Park Chan-wook never skimps on the experience. When you sit down for one of his films, you know it’s going to be a full meal and you know you’re going to run the gamut of laughing, crying, swooning, and gasping, almost always from the edge of your seat. His latest concoction burns slowly, but once the pieces of its Hitchcock-esque scenario fall into place, it plays like a noose tightening very specifically around a lump in one’s throat. 
Flying Masters of Kung Fu 1979;8;  "Flying Masters of Kung Fu" or "Revengeful Swordswoman" is a decently fun martial arts film, specifically in the vein of Wuxia or "Martial Heroes". Being from Taiwan in the 70's, the have a unique application of vision that accompanies their often-budgetary constraints. Where one energy is shifted to another, these films often garnered a somewhat grindhouse energy to their application, making the experience just as enjoyable but within different avenues. Often themes would get borrow from other venues, which is…  
Memory 2022;6;  With the film's poor reviews upon its initial release, I was anticipating something dreadful, but instead got something underwhelming and deceptive. While its true Neeson is in the film, one could argue that, at the end of the day, this is more of a Guy Pearce movie. B oth Liam and Guy are doing well in their roles, with Liam essentially operating on autopilot. Martin has a gift for making even the most poor writing interesting and occasionally exhilarating, however…  
See How They Run 2022;6; I’m pretty sure this whole movie was just an excuse to make us watch Saoirse Ronan in a hat write stuff down in her little notepad, fortunately I’m completely okay with that

Inglourious Basterds 2009;10;  Recently, I rewatched Jackie Brown for the first time in ages, and I still loved it. I still placed it below Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds, but I also hadn’t watched Basterds in a while. Here are my (perhaps Captain Obvious) thoughts:-The opening Christoph Waltz scene and the underground bar scene are both-at the very least-among the best six or seven scenes Tarantino has ever made. I’m not gonna even write about them, cause it’s all been said, and…  
Pretty in Pink 1986;6;                     ENDING SPOILERS AHEAD No one did teen angst quite like John Hughes, the writer was someone who really understood the mixed-up emotions of his characters, helping to inject a welcome dose of honesty into the usual high school tropes here as working class senior Andie (Molly Ringwald) finds herself falling for the well-off Blaine (Andrew McCarthy), oblivious to the torch childhood best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) carries for her. Ringwald excels…

Also you should read this review, good stuff.)Guys, Karsten won't give you attention just because you praise his self-indulgent regurgitation of quirky indie humor.

The Fabelmans 2022;10;  Particularly memorable is the “family meeting” scene (an experience I know all too well). Spielberg cuts from Sam on 35mm to his parents and siblings on 8mm, until finally revealing Sam (again on 35mm) reflected in a mirror, filming the scene with his own camera. Only it’s imaginary, Sam isn’t actually filming his family’s dissolution in real time, but that’s maybe how he wants to remember it—pieces of film he can edit back together in his mind, playing over and…  
Three Colors: White 1994;8; kinda gay 
Morbius 2022;2; Can't wait for Morbius 2: Morb Money Morb Problems. 
Mean Girls 2004;8;  “Grool. I meant to say great but then I started to say cool."-Cady Heron-Mean Girls is a slick, witty, and surprisingly funny prototypical 00’s high-school comedy fare. What separates Mean Girls from the rest of its comedy classmates from that era is its staying power and overarching influence on countless other comedies. It’s the very definition of a cult classic and rightfully so. My wife and I were able to watch this one tonight at our local art-house…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Few horror films have left as indelible a mark on popular culture as Halloween. After more than 40 years' hacking and slashing unsuspecting teenagers, our favourite babysitter obsessive has become a somewhat omnipresent figure. But we are a long way from Carpenter's ghoulish vision of suburbia, or his elegantly simple presentation of the leisurely paced boogeyman. No, the beautiful vintage car, once treasured, has been left out to rust, leading to a limp "conclusion" destined to disappoint.  David Gordon…  
Carrie 1976;10; she did what she had to do 
But I'm a Cheerleader 1999;8; where's rupaul's oscar for the line "i myself was once a gay" 
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;8; mila kunis’ best performance since black swan 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; i like that the patients and deaths in the film were not based directly on any of the actual victims — to avoid naming all of Cullen’s victims as a sign of respect to the families. to prevent retraumatizing family members of those who passed. this is how you respectfully make a movie about a serial killer! 
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;4; i would’ve pushed dean down the stairs idc

Memories of Murder 2003;10;  In America they catch criminals by using their brains, here we rely on our feet, except we're always drop kicking the wrong suspects. In America they search for evidence, we have no need for that here, I can know who's guilty by simply staring into their eyes, except my own eyes had betrayed me time and time again, especially at the most crucial moment. Shit, shit, shit, it's so hard to tell. Documents do not lie, except when the information…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  In den Hemden meiner VäterIn den Schuhen meines Vaters, hörte ich Mama immer predigen. Erhobenen Zeigefinger wie des Richters Hammer, trichterte sie mir dieses eine, immer wiederkehrende Sprichwort ein. Aus dem Meer der Sprichwörter, der Weisheiten seit Anbeginn der Zeit, fischte sie es heraus, nahm es als ihr Leitmotiv, als ihr Mantra und als ihre Direktive, als ihr Gesetz. Was ich, jung und dumm wie ich war, mit den Augen rollend nickend bejahte, sagte, „ja Mama, natürlich Mama, selbstverständlich…  
Barbarian 2022;8; Was anyone else hoping for Baby Oopsie to appear randomly and team up with the mother, or was that just me?! The crossover we need lol. 
Psycho 1960;8; what the fuck? 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;6; Often very entertaining, but for a film that desperately wants to make a point, I found myself wondering too often what the point was. This is most obvious in an elongated misfire of a third act, whose end goal you can see coming a mile away and whose Power Dynamic Reversal! has the depth of a clickbait op-ed headline. Also strange that it spends so much time setting up the main couple (the setup is good!) and then proceeds to ignore them for most of the rest of the film. Oh well. Really great performances all around and *the* scene is genuinely well crafted. GRADE: B- 
Rosaline 2022;6; i want to go to the fountain and do my watercolors 
Mr. Harrigan's Phone 2022;6; you can see why this belongs on netflix (derogatory) 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  A lot has happened, much of it tragic, since the original Black Panther opened four years ago, including the loss of its star Chadwick Boseman. It would be disingenuous for the follow-up to not be mournful. There's a rare quiet that accompanies the film's first moments. Yes this is a Marvel film but it's primarily Ryan Coogler's and again many odds he's succeeded in not becoming a cog in the machine. The difficulty of achieving this is evident during the…  
Whiplash 2014;10; does anyone want to explain to me how miles teller didn't get an oscar for this? absolutely outrageous

(500) Days of Summer 2009;10; The expectations vs. reality scene is one of the most depressing scenes I've ever seen. I always create expectations in my head, but I always end up heartbroken and angry when the reality is different. The first time I watch this film, the expectations vs reality scene made me so sad, cause I know how that feels like.

Halloween Ends 2022;4; I cannot fucking believe they’re letting this guy direct The Exorcist reboot next 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  In retrospect, the behind the scene drama might have been more interesting because Don't Worry Darling is aggressively OK at best and ridiculous in its concept at worse, this could have been a Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episode.From the very start the movie is filled with hints about the mystery of the Victory project: flashbacks, frightening visions, glitches in the world etc... but a great mystery should leave relevant breadcrumbs for the protagonist and the audience. I'm ok with…  
Do Revenge 2022;8; i support women’s rights! but most importantly i support women’s wrongs! 
10 Things I Hate About You 1999;10; kat stratford is the most relatable character of all time because i too am disgusted by all men except 20 year old heath ledger  
Mysterious Skin 2004;10; Gregg Araki made this movie and then made Smiley Face right after which doesn’t really make sense artistically but makes perfect sense psychologically. 
My Policeman 2022;4; Good god I’m glad it’s over. An incredibly dull and lifeless piece right here. The cast are all so boring, I get this movie is rather somber affair but there’s just no energy to it at all, and the cast are to blame, Harry Styles doesn’t even get his cock out, lame, and can someone explain to me why Emma Corrin is popular? Lol. The 2 stars are for the halfway decent love scenes. I prefer my gay dramas a bit more meaty hehehe 😏 
Halloween Ends 2022;6; this did take me 3 separate sessions to finish but i did enjoy the ending, it’s a very 2 and a half movie and that’s okay i still had fun!

Terrifier 2016;2; i hate many things about this clown movie but none more than that i watched it. i guess the real clown was me! 
Fallen Angels 1995;10; Never before has a film so eloquently captured the feeling of driving to McDonalds at 3am. 
Beetlejuice 1988;10; They had to use Michael Keaton in small doses because I don’t think the movie could actually contain the amount of energy he’s bringing. Danny Elfman going hard too but that’s no surprise. Geena Davis <3 
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  The practical effects are just off the charts. These movies aren’t for the squeamish, but if you like hardcore blood and gore, you get that in spades with Terrifier 2.  We’ve even got some dick violence to offset the arguably sexist gaze of the first Terrifier film (though I liked that film as well). Art the Clown is as menacing as ever, but his new little side kick is a creepy and welcome addition to the mayhem. I was worried…  
Black Adam 2022;4; If they hadn't used slow motion in almost every damn scene, the film would have been at least half an hour shorter. 
Shaun of the Dead 2004;10; I’ve probably watched this over 50 times, and every time I enjoy just as much as the first. This for me is the absolute pinnacle of horror/comedy, and actually works much better from a narrative and emotional standpoint than many give it credit for. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN is Martin McDonagh’s finest film yet. A dark comedy that progressively turns profoundly tragic. This is the most deeply layered & dynamic work of Colin Farrell’s career. It’s such a pleasure to see him reunited with Brendan Gleason again who is more reserved but just as impactful. And Kerry Condon gives a spectacular breakthrough performance which should hopefully see her receiving more roles in the future. A mournful & magnificent rumination on lost time, forgotten people & the missed opportunities we don’t take in life to make it all mean something.

Halloween Ends 2022;4;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃If you were expecting a thrilling conclusion to the saga of Michael Myers, forget about it. Director David Gordon Green thought it would be far more interesting to venture way up his own ass to give us this waste-of-time hybrid of 'Rocky V' and Halloween instead."The other kind of evil lives inside of us. Like a sickness or an infection. It's more dangerous because we may not know we're infected ... Am I bad person?…  
Eyes Without a Face 1960;10;  Horror cinema is granted a new face in George Franju’s poetic masterpiece. But from under its skin of haunting beauty, there are the eyes of another master in genre film that are peering out. Franju and Alfred Hitchcock could less said to be father and son in their artistic relationship, as they are estranged brothers. Both auteurs come from a basis in German expressionism, which carries into the distinct visual language of their work. Hitchcock learned of the movement when…

Graveyard Rats 2022;8; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities- Episode 2Rats are such an excellent vehicle for horror and the way Natali confidentially capitalizes on them to not only exploit obvious musophobia, but also claustrophobia is genius. Was slightly thrown off by its inclusion of (something I won’t mention for spoilers sake), would have preferred more rats.Campy, repulsive, and an excellent ending. More of this! More horror with rats! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; Marvel Studios’ #BlackPantherWakandaForever™️ is an INCREDIBLY emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman and easily one of the greatest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! With phenomenal mind-blowing cameos, fantastic references to other movies, emotional sequel setups and a beautiful introduction to Ironheart, I found myself crying tears of despair but also joy at the sheer fact that there will indeed be more of these. Wakanda Forever! YIBAMBE! 👊❤️ 
Before Sunrise 1995;10; I don't know what kind of review I'm supposed to write here other than this is one of the most romantic movies ever made, I mean EVER, even counting future movies that haven't been made or even written yet. It's perfect. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are perfect. The writing is perfect - I read that none of this was improvised, and I don't know how that's even possible. Just magical, all of it. 
Fight Club 1999;10; MARLA YOU LIAR YOU BIG TOURIST I NEED THIS NOW GET OUT 
Barbarian 2022;8; Endlich mal ein Horrorfilm, der wirklich so gut ist, wie es der Hype verspricht. Hat ein paar Probleme mit der Glaubwürdigkeit, aber ich war sehr angetan, wie frisch und frech das in den ersten zwei Dritteln wirkt.Informiert euch nicht. Besser nicht mal die Trailer gucken, dann macht „Barbarian“ richtig Spaß. 
Bros 2022;4;  a failure—but an interesting one. funny often, but never enough to elude the fact that it’s just not working. I am actually a longtime fan of Eichner, for what it’s worth, and thought often of one of his best Billy videos—do gay people care about John Oliver? (kind of!) it’s weird to me that he would then miss that kind of thinking in his own work, which is—do gay people care about the studio romantic comedy? it’s clear that Eichner thinks…

Deadstream 2022;8; 64Fun! You'd think a movie about a cancelled twitch streamer roaming through a haunted house in pursuit of a redemption arc would grate on the nerves, and it does occasionally, but it also made me laugh quite a bit. Excellent monster designs and smooth pacing. Some decent scares as well. Best part had to be the running stream chat throughout. Good shit. 
Prey for the Devil 2022;4; Video here!TL,DW: Lean for sure but not nearly mean enough to be interesting. Actually, it’s kind of shocking how boring this is because it seems like demons are possessing people left and right in this world, but it foregoes being scary for the type of metaphor that is finally starting to annoy me in modern horror. Jaqueline Byers and Christian Navarro are admittedly charming if not as paper thin as the plot. A very meh time. Come on people! What happened to when demons had a sense of humor and called everyone a whore! 
Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky 1991;10;  It was rage that kept him alive. It was courage that set him free. How isn’t every single review starting off with HOLY FUCKING SHIT in bold, italics, and capital letters just for the fuck of it? This is like watching all your favorite genre elements exploding in front of your eyes, melting into your palms and seeping through your fingers. the gore? Dead Alive levels. the brutality? unmatched. the body count?  plenty. Fan Siu-wong? sexy + shirtless.PURE UTTER FUCKING…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10;  Park Chan-wook does Vertigo. With The Handmaiden and now Decision to Leave, Park Chan-wook has reached a level of cinematic craftsmanship that is virtually peerless in the current cinema landscape. Everything seems so effortless and his formal control is so incredibly rigorous. Every shot seems so carefully planned and there are so many creative transitions and edits within Decision to Leave that it feels like a movie made with the utmost precision. Park's earlier films were crude and erratically stylish,…  
The Good Nurse 2022;6;  “I’m going to help you get through this.” -Charlie-The Good Nurse is a compelling, procedural drama that suffers by its paint-by-the-numbers execution. The strong performances by its leads are the saving grace to this otherwise dull and over-bloated true crime adaptation.  Eddie Redmayne and Jessica Chastain quite literally shoulder this film, helping us get through what could have been a retreaded snooze fest.Let’s start with the performances as they are the beating heart behind The Good Nurse. …  
The Princess 2022;6;  This is a spinoff prequel of Joey's character on Bullet Train and no one will change my mind.But seriously, this was nice. Another one of those movies I had no intention of seeing, but the references to The Raid set in a medieval world piqued my interest. And there are definitely some good action scenes, which everyone, including Joey King, does a good job of selling. The rest of the performances are fine, but I think the script's familiarity…

Radio On 1979;8;  "Radio On" is a late 70's British endeavor about a search for meaning in a manner of ways. As the film is a great effort within itself and very purposeful in merit, there is a sense that the title of the film can be a presented misconception for some watching the film blind without research of context first. Possible misconception is more of a negative driver, rather it should be said that the title feels like plays upon two concepts.…  
Moana 2016;6;  Disney veterans John Musker and Ron Clements bring back some of that old magic they brought to earlier collaborations together this likeable coming-of-age adventure, following free-spirited chief’s daughter Moana (Auliʻi Cravalho) as she sets off on a quest to save her island with the reluctant help of proud demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson). While never quite reaching the heights of those 90s classics it takes inspiration from, the film tells an entertaining story about the importance of living up to your…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  ryan coolger made a such beautiful emotional yet heartbreaking film. They way the entire cast honors chadwick baseman and his legacy to t’challa and the black panther was so beautiful. There was not one dry eye in the theater, especially me I couldn’t stop crying. Angela Letitia lupita danai michaela & dominique put their heart and soul into this film and it really showed. Angela deserves some award recognition for her performance. tenoch as namor is the definition of perfect casting,…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  I was more than sceptical with this release given the fact that it is a Netflix original. However, it was really good. It was obvious from the trailers that this was going to be a high tier production. The cinematography really is gorgeous and some of the shots left me in complete awe. The sound design is harrowing, unforgiving and certainly matches the brutal content. No doubt that some of the imagery is incredibly powerful and it does not hold…

Gaslight 1944;10;  For every femme fatale who suffered a slap as noir ran its course as a genre, it must be remembered that one of the genre’s most foundational entries turned on the villainy of masculine inadequacy. That would be George Cukor’s “Gaslight,” a melodrama that precedes the larger noir movement in tone as much as it does in theme. Although, you’d be forgiven for being misled by the dominant narrative that noir sprung solely from the hard-boiled hats of detectives and…

Hocus Pocus 1993;8;  It took me almost three decades, but I eventually caught what is widely regarded as a holiday classic: a film that is quite shocking when compared to the more puritanically hypocritical incarnation of Disney that exists now. We're talking about a film made with young audiences in mind, but which also fully embraced its dark, sarcastic, and horny nature. I mean, just Sarah Jessica Parker is an awakening. And, while Max almost certainly had some with Allison after the film,…

Evil Dead II 1987;10; this is the most excited a movie has ever been to be itself. 
Hellraiser 1987;8;  One of the most unwavering, original, and garage horror films I've ever seen, developing into the twisted macabre of desire, lust, and the terrifying atmosphere of Hell and the Cenobites. Aside from horror, the film has a few other themes. Mostly adultery, with forbidden and hidden lust. To be honest, I had no idea that the hypersexual nature of this was at the forefront. It's amusing when you think about it. Anyway, before watching, I thought the story was much…  
Barbarian 2022;8; Barbarian is wise not to rest on its compelling premise, offering a plot of jolting twists and wild revelations, though not all of them work. In a strong year for original horror - seemingly the only genre able to flourish in our IP-dominated times - this is a true standout. Underpinned by a teasing visual approach, Cregger amuses and terrifies, seduces and repulses, making for one of the most fun, if a little inconsistent, examples of macabre fare in recent memory. 
The Mist 2007;8; Absolutley no fucking way that’s how this movie ended. WHAT IS THIS MAN THINKING?

Navajo Joe 1966;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciGiven his track record, it should come as no surprise that Corbucci frequently recycles the same formulas and templates from his earlier films with minor adjustments.

I personally would love to hear this. Naturally, he does not explain everything, the movie immediately pivots to a cutesy effects-heavy snowball fight and toboggan chase. Oh well.

The Shining 1980;10; You didn’t think I would have any other first choice film for Halloween, did you? 
Barbarian 2022;8;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃A twisty, thrilling, and subverted descent into thinking just how you would handle ending up in the worst Airbnb experience ever."Do I look like some kind of monster?"Barbarian has an amusing way of reeling you into this crazy situation, only to say "Nope" to most of your assumptions about what the hell is going on. But the whole final message that dudes don't come off as being as shitty as they really are, was…  
Bros 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  *my sch*m*r jumpscare  
Dolls 2002;10;  Very nearly forgot that this is a film about love at times given how holistic its demonstration of love is, which is to say that I'm an idiot, but in my defense rarely do most films about "love" explore love without romance, explore love so thoroughly to the point where it is so unconditional, so granted and presumed, that its acknowledgement is rendered irrelevant. I almost don't want to even acknowledge the pairs in here as 'couples' with how much…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; i will not rest until i have made everyone i know watch this movie and until harris dickinson and dolly de leon go home with their well deserved oscars 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Martin McDonagh’s latest, The Banshees of Inisherin, is a great, dark comedy that had me laughing from the very beginning. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are spectacular together as always. They play off each other remarkably well with their characters pushing the story to a dark conclusion that I, for the most part, adored. The score, setting and sets pieces are beautiful with the humour being top notch and darker moments still creating a shock. It’s a great look at…  
Stars at Noon 2022;8;  My understand is that the source novel is very specific. Denis’ movie exists not only in a suspended time, but place as well. Latin America not as a playground for foreign forces as much as this endless dangerous road, the political intrigue remaining an obscure pressure over the two main characters. It is perhaps because I'm currently in an easy mood to connect to an idea of purgatory, but the entire thing remains very appealing for me. Stars at Noon…  
GoodFellas 1990;8; so it turns out the fellas are not exactly good. marty being subversive as hell out here with his titles 
The Thing 1982;10; 100 "Nobody trusts anybody now, and we're all very tired." 
Nope 2022;10; Genuinely in awe after this rewatch. The finale is definitely my favorite out of all blockbusters this year. I love that I learned so many more details on upon this viewing. The last shot of Daniel Kaluuya will always give me the goosebumps. 
Batman Returns 1992;10; our research tells us that voters like fingers 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; Don’t let the good music, pretty camerawork, and great set design distract you from how bad it is 
Vox Lux 2018;10; Sci-fi anthems!!! God, I love this movie. So bizarre and I’m so here for it. Natalie Portman as a chaotic pop star having meltdowns all over the place. There is nothing Natalie Portman can’t do! The soundtrack is pretty great too. 
The Woman King 2022;8; You know this rules hard when Viola Davis stops a bullet with her giant sword 
Barbarian 2022;8; Just one day in my life I want to be as happy as Justin Long measuring the basement. 
Terrifier 2 2022;10; this was so much fun! only minutes into the movie, i already couldn't stop smiling from art's facial expressions alone. the kills are creative and really fucked up, the effects are great, and art is hilarious. one part of the plot kind of threw me off, but i absolutely loved everything else about this movie. i can't wait to make my friends watch this with me. 
The Worst Person in the World 2021;10; babe wake up a new relatable sad girl who feels lost in life just dropped 
Evil Dead II 1987;8; Most say this is a reboot of the first one, but I like to think Ash was just dumb enough to bring his new girlfriend to the cabin for round two. 
When Harry Met Sally... 1989;10; 1989 meg ryan is the most beautiful woman in the world. Billy crystal is probably part goblin but i love him 2 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Haha those joke suits for Ironheart and Midnight Angel were pretty funny, when do we get to see the real ones 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  This really exceeded my expectations. Right from the announcement of this movie I was quite skeptical about it but I can happily say the movie was pretty amazing.The movie handles the passing of Chadwick Boseman in the most respectful and emotional way possible. His absence was really felt throughout the movie. The plot and screenplay here was great. Every scene is structured very cleverly and it is executed beautifully. The movie was a visual delight, the underwater sequences looked…  
Fries! The Movie 2021;4; Wie ich meine Pommes am liebsten mag: Lang und dünn und mit sehr begrenztem Nährwertgehalt.Wie ich meine Dokus über Pommes am wenigsten mag: Lang und dünn und mit sehr begrenztem Nährwertgehalt. 
Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo! 2022;6;  Scooby Doo written by someone who doesn’t like Scooby Doo.I remember when meta humor was a fun wink to the audience and not writers going “Isn't this dumb? We’re going to point it out while still doing it meaning it’s clever”. That’s what a lot of this feels like. Just a bunch of jokes about how Scooby-Doo does the same thing over and over for all eternity. Which makes me feel like the writers only have a superficial understanding…  
RRR 2022;10; RRR isThe best action movie of the yearThe best musical of the yearThe best romantic comedy of the yearThe best historical drama of the year And the best movie ever made about fighting colonialism with dance battles and armies of rampaging animals and most of all, friendship 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  This was great😂 I believed this was more true then the Marilyn Monroe biopic.I knew after watching about 5 min of watching Weird Al I knew I was going to enjoy it, I felt like the beginning hour was absolutely fantastic and full of laughs however, when they introduced Madonna I found myself losing interest in the story and thought it went very far from being even close to believable which made it more like just a weird movie…  
Nope 2022;10; Barbie ferreira has more screentime in this than the entirety of euphoria season 2 
Jennifer's Body 2009;6; they didn’t even do a wardrobe test on chris pratt he just showed up like that 
Parasite 2019;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  call me by your name’s cum peach walked so parasite’s killer peach could run  
Barbarian 2022;6; these characters are just so dumb, like wtf, who sees a room like that in the basement of the house and automatically doesn't call the police?!? 
Halloween Ends 2022;10;  Spooky Season Ranked (2022)Labels, man. I know a little something about how powerful labels can be. You see, I was the kind of kid who didn't fit in a neat little box. Who wasn't easy to categorize. Who didn't conform to society's expectations, and thus, became a target for labels. To the adults around me, I was a puzzle to solve. A conundrum. A kid with some manner of behavioral disorder that needed to be diagnosed and fixed. A…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Video here!A lot of people throw up, Harris Dickinson does his best Blue Steel, Woody Harrelson is a drunken Marxist. It’s fun and funny and I didn’t feel a second of the runtime, in large part due to the excellent ensemble cast. The satire of course is extremely unsubtle but I think it’s intentional - the exaggeration is what allows it to be so absurd and effective. Some bits in here are priceless, especially in the second act. Did not like the ending though! 
Being John Malkovich 1999;10;  An existential fantasy exploring identity and escapism.Charlie Kaufman is one of the cinemas most important storytellers of the past 20 years and Jonze the perfect companion to help tell them. Underneath his intricately woven labyrinthine structures lie real people tragically lost in a lonely world. They convey the unfathomable complexity of reality as experienced by simple pathetic individuals. "Being John Malkovich" essentially translates to "Being Free". It isn't his identity they want it is the freedom his wealth and…  
James and the Giant Peach 1996;8; The story is simple, but Selick’s technical achievements are staggering. Stop-motion has rarely been more convincingly tactile, and the dark fantasy aesthetic he provides the live-action material allows for dazzling moments of magical realism throughout. With respect to Spielberg, The BFG would’ve been so much more successful if it looked like this instead of an elaborate screensaver. As for the beguiling Miss Spider? Words fail me. 
Who Killed Captain Alex? 2010;10;  ***The ElCochran90 Discord Server 's Watch Party Redeem #10*****Mutual consensus watch (with mics open).***Find full updated list here*.A serious review from a serious man (lame Coen pun intended, but it will be serious from this point).Who Killed Captain Alex? defies normal and standard rules of film criticism, because this film reinvented cinema. The reasons why it caught attention are the superficial, tongue-in-cheek ones, and it was inevitable: our rational line of thought got challenged by Ugandan…  
The Viewing 2022;6;   Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities - 7/8 Guests are welcome. It will catch your interest but at the ultimate cost. There are experiences in life that will shake you to the core, and then those in which will leave a lasting and polarising mark that sticks around.No words possibly exist that can do justice to describing this. Not to say it is above all in the standard. When you have seen anything Panos has done before, and then…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; It’s heart is in the right place, but this does too much to try and be it’s own movie but also jam in the marvel superhero blueprint we all know too well. Very choppy but a few great refreshing, non-explosion fest moments. Most real stuff Marvel has put out but still suffers so much from the formula 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  SO SO SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE!!First of all I would like to say been a little slow on the watches and reviews this weekend as I’ve been trying to grow my tiktok and would really appreciate some of you checking it out and maybe giving us a follow -@Eccyfilmreviews.So on to the review Enola Holmes 2 I found was significantly better then the first instalment even tho I enjoyed it this had better story and…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Not Selick’s next masterpiece, but special and cute. It’s a shame the story is so needlessly overcomplicated and risk averse because all of the characters are very charming, and of course the craftsmanship is out of this world. Selick and his team are just showing off at this point. More movies that teach kids about the prison industrial complex, I guess! Bonus points for James Hong, as always. 
Lot 36 2022;6; I’m sure it’s only that Tim Blake Nelson is a great actor, but let’s just say I wouldn’t visit the Capitol Building with him. 
Terrifier 2 2022;4;  I did see a tweet the other day about how we seem to have lost low budget trash. I do agree with that…we once had Doris Wishman and Hershel Gordon Lewis and we don’t really have any contemporary equals that I can name off the top of my head. I suppose now I can say for certain Damien Leone fits that mold but there is a catch…As much as I hated the first Terrifier (which I would not really…  
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;6; It’s fun. Tatiana Maslaney is one of the best casting choice in the MCU ever. She’s so perfect for this role and if it weren’t for her I don’t think the series would work at all. Would have liked more of her and Daredevil. Not just because I’m a daredevil shill but because I genuinely loved their chemistry, honestly would like to see her in Born Again as long as they manage to work her into that darker tone 
Entergalactic 2022;8; We as a society owe everything to Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse (2018) 
Beetlejuice 1988;8; the dinner party dance scene is peak cinema. 
My Policeman 2022;4; Can we stop the Harry Styles in movies train before it leaves the station pleaseLFF 
Graveyard Rats 2022;10; watch the black and white version on netflix under 'trailers & more' for a real fun time 
Big Hero 6 2014;8; I want Baymax by my side whenever I am going through a difficult time in my life. I'm sure just hugging him will make my life better. I wish this film were true so I could finally say, "I'm satisfied with my care." 
Psycho 1960;10;  Before the Janet Leigh shower scene, no one in America knew what a naked woman's body looked like, in fact, most women didn't even know you were supposed to be nude to bathe. Hitchcock's suggestion of nudity on film and frank depiction of sex outside of wedlock created horniness for the first time in our history. Hitchcock got everyone sprung before immediately showing the most brutal murder that had ever been depicted in art. The juxtaposition of these two heretofore…  
Memories of Murder 2003;10; I love when the dude in this just dropkicks everyone 
Eyes Wide Shut 1999;10; this isn't even a thriller, rich people just be like that 
Brokeback Mountain 2005;10; imagine wanting to kiss someone so bad that you literally almost break their fucking nose trying 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Martin McDonagh is known for his acerbic wit. A wit so acerbic that one could be forgiven for missing the strain of melancholy embedded within his cinematic work, but there’s certainly no missing it here. Few writers are as masterful at balancing the darkest of comedy with the tenderest of lyricism, and The Banshees of Inisherin represents the purest example of this unique style. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are the perfect vehicles for McDonagh's sharply written words, helping to fashion…  
Poltergeist 1982;8; I previously rated this movie much lower. I rewatched it and I enjoyed it more than I previously remembered. When I was a teenager this movie was replayed so much that I almost got sick of it. It didn’t help that my parents had HBO at the time and they played it quite often and they often brought it back. When watching there was a lot I had forgotten. From the legendary Tobe Hooper. If you haven’t seen it in awhile then it should be a rewatch. I saw it on regular AMC but it is also available on HBO Max. 
Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 2022;4; even the crocodile sounds gay 
House on Haunted Hill 1999;6; pressing play on a feature starring ali larter and you just know it’s about to be a hoot and a half 
Piggy 2022;8;  How do you talk? Oink, oink, oink? although this follows the exact same template as its short predecessor, Piggy or Cerdita takes an unconventional route completely separating itself from the “victim finally getting sweet bloody revenge on their tormentors” narrative while still maintaining that very uneasy feeling the short film was seeped in. combining coming-of-age romance meets dealing with your own moral compass. what’s worse, fighting off your tormentors or your inner demons? Carlota Peroda knew how to get her audience to…  
An American Werewolf in London 1981;8; the people making this movie: *cracking knuckles* aight how many songs about the moon can we fit into 97 minutes 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story walked hard fifteen years ago so Weird: The Al Yankovic Story could run away with the musical biopic in 2022.This ain't a biopic, it's a goddamn arms race and Weird Al is fitting us with weapons in the form of comedy. He always has actually, but instead of parody music, it's in parody movie form this time and how wonderful and charming and over the top it is. I think I've rarely had…  
Requiem for a Dream 2000;8; Made me miss my Vyvanse prescription. All around feel good flick. It's like Ferris Bueller on heroine. 
Tarantula 1955;8;  "Tarantula" is simple, formulaic atomic age 50's movie fun. Brought to the screen by director Jack Arnold, who most notably delivered the infamous "Creature from the Black Lagoon" (1954), but also endeavors like "It Came from Outer Space" (1953) and "The Incredible Shrinking Man" (1957), "Tarantula" is a perfect blend of schlocky science fiction kitsch mixed with elements of shock horror in a time when going to the movies was full of pure escapism. Retrospectively, there is actually an elegance…  
Pigs and Battleships 1961;8;  Imperialism's best weapon is perhaps its ability to let the imperialized hang themselves. Once in power, there's not much the Americans have to do to keep it here – the Japanese women are all too eager to marry and please an American man to move up in life and the Japanese men are more than happy to pimp them out if it means they get a cut, with no value placed on Japanese identity. They spend their whole lives jockeying…  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;8; a quantidade de vezes que simplesmente falei "eu" enquanto assistia foi bem preocupante 
The Addams Family 1991;8; morticia and gomez are truly relationship goals. living in a gothic mansion with my goth children and my goth soulmate sounds perfect 
The Royal Tenenbaums 2001;8; “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” 
Beast 2022;2; Dumb films are becoming increasingly popular this year.In this film, everyone and everything is stupid. Not to mention the forced family drama. It was so annoying that I wished the lion would eat them. 
Suspiria 1977;10;  Legendary horror film soundtrack composer Claudio Simonetti and his group, Goblin, performed their legendary original score live alongside last nights screening of Suspiria at Somerville Theatre. It was fuckin electric The crowd was great, everyone was super engaged clapping for Simonetti during breaks in the score and laughing along with some of the films more absurd scenes. The band was super tight and the sound mixing with the screening behind it was done wonderfully, it really synced together for a…  
Aftersun 2022;10; This film has one of the greatest final shots I’ve seen in a long long time. Truly breathtaking  Insane that this is Charlotte Wells’ debut feature 🤯 What a way to announce yourself to the world 
Hocus Pocus 1993;6; Nothing would happen if I lit that candle.😎 
Fight Club 1999;10; fellas it IS gay 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; Shush and underestimate women and you'll see. It only takes one flame to start a fire. 
Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare 2010;10;  “What part of “get out save yourselves” didn’t you understand? How ‘bout this one time we listen to the wild eyed lunatic?”Mark Hamill’s greatest role isn’t Luke Skywalker or the Joker, no it’s Babyface Boretti from the cinematic masterpiece Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare.This is an all around great Scooby-Doo mystery that fires in all cylinders. It’s energetic, funny, lighthearted, and most of all fun. I mean, it’s Scooby-Doo meets Friday the 13th meets Meatballs! Does anyone think that sounds…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  It's weird. I like weird. I also like Andi Matichak embracing her darkness (out of nowhere/fine by me), dancing to the Dead Kennedys (yes the Halloween song), and her goth girl pants. These little messed up lovers and their rebelliousness in the night is really carrying this movie for me further than it should. So David Gordon Green made a trilogy of Halloween movies that go like this: *a 70s character based, attempt at "elevated" trauma horror *a straight down…  
Scream 2022;8; I just know half of those people have letterboxd accounts. no wonder that happened 
Pearl 2022;10;  La mejor película de horror del 2022. 🖤Muy pocas historias de terror se preocupan por la psique o el sentir de sus personajes y menos de manera tan profunda cómo el tratamiento que le dan a Pearl.Fuera de las grandes secuencias de asesinato y de toda la sangre, hay un gran trasfondo dónde el verdadero miedo es el mostrar quién realmente somos, la soledad, el sentirnos menospreciados, el sentir que nuestra vida NUNCA va a cambiar dónde toda…  
The Wailing 2016;10;  Brilliantly paced police procedural that evolves into sinister ritualistic horror. Some people take exception to its run time but I think its part of the films strength. It cleverly avoids the slaying preferring to focus on the aftermath and never allows you to get close to any answers until the very final, very sobering end. The dad is frustratingly impulsive which is the clever key to the films plot and trickery. Its completely unrealistic, the government would have intervened well…  
Mulholland Drive 2001;10;  "It'll be just like in the movies. Pretending to be somebody else."Mulholland Drive is beautiful, ugly, poignant, haunting, hilarious, dark, nightmarish, mesmerizing, thought-provoking, puzzling, confounding. David Lynch captures broken dreams that is the essence of Hollywood.Mulholland Drive is about human beings and their ability to dream, imagine and fantasize about the life they want instead of the life they have. Order is an illusion, everything is arbitrary and no-one is control of anything at all. We might have…  
Dirtbag 2022;2;  One day, cinema, film, or any of the sort will just be foreign words, terms used solely by historians attempting to analyze relics from bygone eras, what will become our era. Whether it is in a century, or a few millennia, is irrelevant. Someday, shit will hit the fan, and all the hallmarks of the present, including the art of today, will be lost. At least for the most part, and all left will be but ancient ruins, and if…  
Vengeance 2022;8;  This is an unusual piece of work, but it is creative and original (in some ways). A film that covers so much thematic ground that I have to applaud it for its breadth. I will always appreciate and admire a film that is clearly the result of a single person's creative vision. Clearly, BJ Novak had some things to say, and this film frequently feels like an outlet for him to express his feelings about humanity.Unfortunately, ambition sometimes comes…  
Starship Troopers 1997;10; “The mobile infantry made me the man I am today” 
Ice Age 2002;6; The absolute epitome of “it’s fine” 
Fresh 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i just know that armie hammer LOVED this  
Scream 4 2011;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  "basically the only way to survive a horror movie is to be gay"you heard it folks. sidney survived 4 scream movies by the sheer power of lesbianism alone  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;8;  ok it was good - one of the better documentaries and selena seems like one of the better super-famous pop idols of our time. the bits of her going back to her hometown were the best, so wholesome. i also like how she touched on mindless promo and interviews making her feel like a product. that shit must suck big time. it was also a pretty honest and real depiction of mental health so good on her for showing it…  
The Slumber Party Massacre 1982;8; oh, so this movie is "feminist"? then why did my "boyfriend" have to tell me it's an "auger" and not a "drill"? 
Pearl 2022;10; Ok, WOW!! This was excellent, such a great film, very impressed. So very different to X, and yet still in the same family. A tour-de-force turn by Mia Goth, if they gave out Oscars for movies like this, she’d win, easily one of the strongest performances of the year, what a star she is, and absolutely bonkers. Love the whole aesthetic. 
Lost Highway 1997;10; Watching Robert Loggia run an asshole tailgater off the road and then recite driving safety information while beating the shit out of him is one of the most cathartic experiences I have ever had. 
Seed of Chucky 2004;6; kind of have to respect don mancini making his debut film a queer family melodrama/meta-slasher that’s part scream 3 and glen or glenda. somehow forgot about the part where john waters takes voyeuristic creep shots of chucky masturbating and then in the next scene gets his head melted by acid. jennifer tilly in these probably should be in the pantheon of dual-role performances. 
Kill Bill: Vol. 2 2004;10; there's nothing more therapeutic than hugging a teddy bear after all that happened 
Decision to Leave 2022;8; 75/100Alternate Ending review, in which I couldn't find a non-clumsy way to include Park's finest twinned "joke": (1) Detective tells his partner to get something "not too expensive" for lunch, then proceeds to order high-end sushi for himself and the beautiful suspect he's interrogating ("Is that the Shima Sushi premium dinner combo?!"), (2) Later, when the detective feels betrayed by the beautiful suspect, he orders her what I'm pretty sure from her expression must be the Korean equivalent of a corn dog. Anyway, terrific movie. 
Hellraiser 2022;4;  28Where's the kink? Where's the lust? Even if you take a mere cursory glance at this pitiful franchise, it's clear that only the first film fully developed any productive ideas of pleasure and pain, with their origins intertwined but distorted and misshapen. Anything after, even Hellbound and Hell on Earth, start to lose a certain level of sexual exploration as they attempt to expand on the mythology. The original film was genuinely transgressive and shocking for its time, and…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10;  To others I am green like the mountains, to you I am simply blue. Our first meal together was fish, our first word together was "waterproof" (adjective: impenetrable by water), together we are the ocean. We both come from the mountains, our origin is the mist, like turtles, our destination is the sea. There we will gather and bury our secret, somewhere deep and can not be reached, our secret is our love, yes, us, we, ours -- a love…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; An SNL skit that answers one question: What if you took the characters from Halloween and stuck them in poorly shot, terribly acted, and laughably directed coming of age drama?One of the most insane theatrical experiences of the year for all the wrong reasons.Just to clarify: I admire the ambition and the big swings, but the execution of most of those swings is so abysmal that I can’t give it a pass just for trying 
Saw 2004;10; and to think it all started with two boyfriends laying on a stinky bathroom floor 
Dead Poets Society 1989;10; the face neil makes after mr keating makes todd improvise that poem in class.... those were the most beautiful heart eyes i’ve ever seen, that boy was in love 
Black Adam 2022;8;  I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t been the biggest fan of the DCEU so far, it’s got its highs and lows like every studio but the lows can be truly dreadful. That being said, I’ve been hyped for Black Adam for a while now and, while the film does have some big issues and carries all the shortcomings of your usual superhero origin, it’s a film I constantly had a great time with throughout. This is the role…  
TÁR 2022;10; ► Watch my full review in this videoHere’s the beautiful thing about all of this: Todd Field has no interest in easy answers. TÁR is a movie that trusts the intelligence of its viewers, that demands attention to detail and wants to start a discussion rather than tell you what to think or how to feel, which is something that has become increasingly rare in modern cinema. 
TÁR 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   femme whiplash 😍EDIT to say:In my work meeting this week, I found myself heartily endorsing TÁR — "Oh, I loved TÁR. Really good." A coworker who hadn't seen it piped up — "oh yeah, isn't that the anti-Me Too movie?" The line hits well. I can understand the allure of the easy summary. A movie about a predatory lesbian written and directed by a white man, starring a magnificent performance by a straight A-list actress whose best performance…   
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; WEIRD: THE AL YANKOVIC STORY turns the musical biopic on its head with an outrageously funny, not to be taken seriously parody. The best of its kind since Walk Hard. Daniel Radcliffe’s go-for-broke comedic performance easily ranks among his best. A wild riot of a good time with plenty of laughs, cameos & historical inaccuracies. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Whoa, Nelly was this long, but it was good. I think I liked it more than the first, storyline was better I reckon. Great female cast too, Angela Bassett really shined bright. Why it feel so much like an Avatar movie though? 
See How They Run 2022;6; Cute, if not a little boring and uninteresting. It looks fantastic though and Saoirse Ronan has the charm set to maximum. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; Ever since Al first appeared,Everyone said he was "Weird".In his biopic,His life of shtick,Is probably why he's revered. 
Smile 2022;6;  😁😁😁😁Smile was … mid, I can’t believe how well this is performed at the box office and how many people are talking about this movie because it felt so predictable and after watching so many horrors this year like Barbarian and X, this was very forgettable in comparison to them. I thought Sosie Bacon did a decent job and will probably start being cast in a lot more because of the success of this so would be great to…  
The Good Nurse 2022;6; Damn did they forget to pay the light bill in this hospital 
Train to Busan 2016;8; it’s a shame they were distracted by the zombie apocalypse because that route looked scenic as hell 
Cloverfield 2008;8; Moral of the story, don't live in New York.

Jennifer's Body 2009;10; my tit 
House 1977;10;  Sixty in September: 10/60There are so many things to be fascinated by in this beautiful, wild movie, but two things really stick out to me. Obayashi talks about them in the interview on the Criterion materials:One is the war and the atomic bombings. Obayashi is originally from Hiroshima. He says, quietly and candidly, that most his friends didn't survive the bombings, as a child. The second is Obayashi's sense of how children view and experience the world. He…  
The Exorcist 1973;8; I hope when my daughter hits puberty it'll be a tad less eventful. 
Pearl 2022;6;  45With a striking and melodramatic color palette and a more psychological focus, Pearl does have its unique attributes compared to the grindhouse terror of X, but it struggles to rise above the ambitions of a neat side project. As a concept, it lacks the genre context of what made Ti West's previous film so refreshing and bare-bones. Pearl barely feels developed. Here, West seems like a fish out of water, struggling to shape Pearl into both a villainous presence…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;6;  It breaks my heart to give any stop-motion film a middling or negative review but this film was insanely overstuffed. Visually it’s spectacular, absolutely no complaints. Story-wise? It sorta borders on bad? It sets some things up well but then smashes two other movies together with the current one they’re making, and it just doesn’t work. Things just sort of happen for no reason, contrivances everywhere, the themes are effectively shoehorned into the narrative. The plot is fundamentally broken despite…  
Hellraiser 2022;8;  Man! David's Brucker audition for a new SAW entry was actually pretty good.As I have stated, I don't consider these "Hellraiser" films to be among my favorites in the horror genre, despite their intriguing premise and setting. Though bare in mind I've only seen three of them, counting this one, which I think is sufficient given that the rest are apparently utter cinematic diarrhea.I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it or not, but after hearing how…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  There is no shortage of expansive anti-war films. Many great filmmakers have attempted to make the definitive one. In that sense, All Quiet on the Western Front doesn't feel like anything particularly new, and that’s besides the fact that the film isn’t the first adaptation of this specific tale. However, the film's familiarity shouldn't be seen as a weakness. This is a stunningly crafted piece of cinema capturing a hideous event with an unflinching bombast but also tender reflection. Edward Berger…  
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;6; Apart from some weird editing choices to link a subpar story with some dark subject matter, I was constantly distracted by the fact that Mila Kunis and Finn Wittrock might just be the hottest fictional on-screen couple ever. 
Hocus Pocus 1993;10; the way that this entire movie’s plot revolves around a high school boy being a virgin and they don’t let you forget it 
Friday the 13th 1980;6; A very violent Scooby-Doo episode 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  What Ryan Coogler managed to do with a giant hole left in the franchise, after Chadwick Boseman's passing, is extremely commendable. The grief and heartbreak is on full display here, and the atmosphere created by such themes will make audiences emotional in the opening minutes alone. The entire cast brought their A-game to convey feelings every fan of Chadwick has felt over these past years.The film itself can feel convoluted at times, with several storylines that lack any narrative…

The relationship a boy has with his father greatly shapes the man he will become in the future. Here are some awesomely manly activities that you can do with your son to strengthen that paternal bond. ✅ Go Fishing ✅ Play Catch ✅ Fill in a Well ✅…  
The Asphalt Jungle 1950;10; Whenever the old guy’s mistress was onscreen I thought, “Holy mackerel, who is this actress? She looks like Marilyn Monroe!” And then I found out from the end credits that it was Marilyn Monroe.Seven men in varying degrees of desperation take part in a jewel heist. They’ve got it all planned perfectly. And hey, maybe they’ll get away with it. Does everything really need to go without a hitch? 
In Fear 2013;2; the title of this movie in Brazil is "A Night to Forget", but as my father said:This movie should be called "A Movie to Forget". 
The Hellbenders 1967;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciFor his next Western, Corbucci tells a relatively familiar story about a group of Confederates who, although having lost the war, are still in complete denial, to this is added the element of greed, which, at first subtlety and then clearly, unveils that we are in fact witnessing a psychological Western in which the real antagonist of these villains is not those who try to stop them, but themselves.…

Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Halloween Ends Tonight!I watched it, several minutes ago, I was told there was nothing left, no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of how to finish this series, or how to create a good or compelling narrative, or even right or wrong kills. I met this... movie with this blank, pale, emotionless story, and... the tag-team kills - the godawful WWE tag team kills! I spent an hour trying to stay engaged, and then…  
Possession 1981;10;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberHumans are complicated. Give them too much freedom, and they will become wild animals. Repress them, and they should turn into devils.A film in which anarchy is the norm might seem like an unlikely candidate to have anything to do with repression, but this is actually the case in many ways. I don't think it was a coincidence that "The Wall" is present throughout, giving the film a political backdrop that,…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Score : 7.7/10 ✅A tad too preoccupied with plugging content for future Marvel movies/series and a bit too artificial when it comes to birthing a ‘’new’’ Black Panther figure, this last film from Phase 4 felt overstuffed regardless of Ryan Coogler's best effort. But at the end of the day, that’s also a tribute to Chadwick Boseman and what Black Panther represented, so in that regard, I understand why Wakanda Forever is hold in high regard right now. And…

Death on the Run 1967;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciCorbucci's foray into the spy genre is far from his best work. In fact, the film appears to be stuck in a rut of clichés and a somewhat generic premise. The film's blend of the spy genre and what appears to be film noir doesn't quite work, and it doesn't help that the cinematography, direction, and acting all make the film feel less like a high calibre feature film…  
Sophia Antipolis 2018;8;  Here is what I imagine Dante's hell would look like if written today, some seventh-layer named "Sophia, the up-and-coming yuppie city" being an urban haven full of high-value humans all involved in pointless start-ups and techno-academia. Places like this are full of glimmer and gold but like, does anyone actually get any fulfillment working in these fields or are they just lying to themselves and everyone else?There is, I feel, some kind of switch in the human brain that…

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004;10;  This movie DESTROYED me.It somehow reminded me of a quote from Call Me by Your Name:"If there is pain, nurse it. And if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with it. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new."The truth is: we place too much value…

Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains 2019;10;  Well-meaning shirking of familial responsibilities: the movie. Communal traditions and the expectations that come with it vs individual desires and the sacrifices they require, etc. – most self-selecting viewers are gonna know the gist by now but it's still uncomfortably relatable for likely an uncomfortable majority. A condition of living for these comes a constant anxiety dwelling in the everyday, and at some point it compounds into a fragile midpoint: enough to hamper the life trajectory of one and those…  
TÁR 2022;10; Tár is a compelling film about the corrosive cocktail of power, respect, and talent, and what happens to those who imbibe. It invites you into the intoxicating upper echelons of music to marvel at its edifice and institutions (and ask: at what cost?). Blanchett is god-tier. 
Beetlejuice 1988;8; I didn't expect this to be as funny and extremely original as it was, I'm not such a fan of Tim Burton's movies, except for Corpse Bride, but in this case it was different, and I think I know why: the incredible practical effects (the scene where they go to a kind of limbo and there we are introduced to characters so well characterized was amazing) and the characters are extremely funny.Tim burton ranked

Wendell & Wild 2022;4; 😴😴😴Edit: esse personagens são tão rasos e desinteressantes que chega a me dar ódio, conclusão tosca e previsível. 
The Big Sleep 1946;10; one of the ultimate 'i have no idea what happens in the story, but the vibes are impeccable' films. bogie and bacall's romance is a cinematic gift, we need more movies that don't explain themselves to the audience, more movies that are willfully obscure and obtuse. there's a filthy mysticism to the big sleep that i find intensely compelling. 
Gomorrah 2008;8; A glimpse into the unglamorous reality of the inner workings of the Italian mafia. All levels of life are polluted with the putrescent grime of crime. There is no escape. No hope. No redemption. Only mamma mia.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; A big bloated mess but a big bloated mess that separates itself from the crowd of recent soulless MCU outings by actually having heart and some semblance of a voice behind it. A voice that gets lost in a disastrous third act, but one that still delivers some of the most moving moments the MCU has ever seen. Coogler really gets this shit, just sucks that everything couldn’t come together neatly. 
Point Break 1991;10;  I've seen the term "A Slam-Bang Thriller!" tossed around a lot over the years on DVD covers and online movie review articles but when it comes to the definition of that statement, I truly believe that Point Break takes the cake as the perfect representation. It obviously slams and it obviously bangs, but it's also an electric, exciting, endlessly quotable and simply iconic action-thriller. Kathryn Bigelow really crafted a goddamn classic here and there would absolutely be no Fast & Furious…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Ainda tentando processar tudo e pensando no que dizer, mas já adianto, essa obra cinematográfica é IMPECÁVEL, peak MCU!Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, tem facilmente potencial para ser o melhor filme da Marvel Studios.

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;4; Every single cliché ever associated to war films is in this film.Ridiculously unoriginal.Not even a great adaptation of the book.Even more exhausting and flawed on a rewatch. The best production, camerawork and sound design in the world doesn't hide how much of a palpably pungent piece of German Victimization propaganda this actually is 
Magic 1978;8;  This film is like a box of chocolates, you never know what to expect. I mean, you have a picture that would normally feature and be made by a low-level actor and director that everyone would probably forget. And yet, you have Richard Attenborough directing a film written by William Goldman, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, and starring a deranged young Anthony Hopkins in a dual role as this pathetic puppeteer and the voice of this diabolical puppet whose banter is…  
Emily the Criminal 2022;8;  So, it turns out the critics were correct. Featuring Aubrey Plaza at the height of her abilities, this is a thrilling ride. The film makes excellent use of Plaza's trademark deadpan humor and affable demeanor, and the actress also conveys a surprising amount of nuanced feeling, turning Plaza into a sympathetic protagonist whose actions you can't help but support, despite your understanding of how wrong they are. The movie does an excellent job of turning her into an anti-heroine figure,…

Deadstream 2022;6; I enjoyed it for the most part but at one point got bored and not even Gollum's special cameo could make it interesting. I do appreciate the effort to make something different from the usual. It's refreshing to see a film that doesn't use cheap jump scares every five seconds but when it's appropriate instead, and that was some nice makeup on those ghosts. Except for Mildred, they just threw white paint at her face and moved on. 
Rosaline 2022;8;  Rosaline is a fantastic high energy reimagining of Shakespeare’s classic Romeo & Juliet tale. Kaitlyn Dever is amazing. Her fierce and witty charm as Rosaline bring something new to this tale with Kyle Allen’s Romeo, Isabela Merced’s Juliet and Sean Teale‘a Dario rounding out what is a great cast, all portraying these classic characters with brilliant effect. While it's admittedly silly, it’s also smart and snappy, with the dialogue always popping and direction working a charm. For a Disney plus original…

Aftersun 2022;10; This movie touched the G spot in my heart. Now that I have seen this twice I can confirm it’s a masterpiece. Sophie and Calum’s relationship is one of the most beautiful and deeply painful that I’ve seen on screen. So many spectacular visual choices. Lots to say that requires me to go in depth with spoilers which I’ll do eventually. Stunning. Obsessed with it.Update: made the analysis

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10; The best biopic since Walk Hard. Enough said. 
The Outside 2022;6; Deconstructing consumerism and our society’s obsession with ‘beauty’, The Outside is certainly the most broadly satirical piece in the series so far, but your mileage may vary on how successful that satire is. Nevertheless, I appreciated some of the directorial flourishes Amirpour is able to inject into the film, and it’s commendable that del Toro’s collection seems to be giving different flavours of horror rather than stubbornly sticking to the same sub-genre. 
Terrifier 2 2022;10;  This movie was gory awesomeness Director Damien Leone didn’t disappoint! This was gorier than Terrifier. The story though was much better and many developed characters. I was especially impressed by Lauren LaVera who I was rooting for the whole time. David Howard Thornton didn’t disappoint as Art the clown. I also enjoyed Felissa Rose small role. I enjoyed performance of Sara Voigt as the mom and Amelia McLain as the pale girl. Also Casey Hartnett pulled off the goriest scene…  
The Viewing 2022;8;  CIGARETTES KILLEver since the day MANDY released, to say I’ve been eagerly awaiting the next project by Panos Cosmatos would be an understatement. I can delightfully say that THE VIEWING retains all of the neon grainy phantasmagorical horror style one would hope for. The glowing golden color palette of this film is just visually remarkable, Cosmatos has created a hue I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before, allowing our characters to bathe in it as they snort quite a…

The Inhabitant 2022;4; Yeahhh this sucked. There's a part when a girl gets hacked with an axe in her shoulder and she shakes violently screaming, and it's so hilariously goofy my wife and I watched it four times and couldn't stop cackling 
The Virgin Suicides 1999;10; Amidst the magnificent soundtrack and the extraordinarily khaki cinematography, one must not overlook the work of Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator — or is it narrators? He provides one of the most effective voice-only performances I can think of in movies: Evocative, conversational, insinuating, specific, universal, and oh so sad. 
Dark Glasses 2022;6; From the master Dario Argento. A shudder original. It is nice to new movie from Dario Argento but this one was kinda boring. It is watchable and has merit because of Dario Argento. It is not unbearable. I would like to see more shudder originals from horror masters. You can check it out on Shudder.

Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The plot of this movie unbeatable: an evil company town that manufactures Halloween novelties that is full of evil Irish people and their robot goons working for an evil Irish wizard who wants to turn every American child's head into a writhing mass of insects and snakes using the power of TV commercials and a stolen piece of Stonehenge. This movie is in the conversation with 'Patriot Games' and every movie ever made about British royalty as the most anti-Irish…   
Ghosted 2022;8;  Call me a pessimist or whatever you want, but I feel that perhaps due to the inherent corruption of the human being (or their imperfections, whatever you wanna call it), many (if not all) of us, we are uncapable of giving our all to someone or something as we risk sliding into obsession or destructive disappointment. We live in such a cruel world in which even the most copious kindness or love could result in someone more than likely taking…

Black Adam 2022;2; one of the messiest and uninteresting films I’ve seen all year. you don’t feel shit for the characters nor for the story. the action was pretty mediocre too while blended in choppy second by second editing. visually, this film still sucks. most of the effects look barely completed.the film itself just put an average taste in my mouth by the end of it. will be my first and last time watching this.

Corpse Bride 2005;10; I’m starting a petition for a live action version with Timothee Chalamet and Laura Harrier 
Before Sunset 2004;10; Turns out I've never had a conversation before. 
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Stunning animation with a mildly interesting story.The protagonist was very irritating. It was difficult for me to root for her.The ending felt rushed. The animation made this film worth watching. 
Inferno 1980;8;  have always loved that this one is basically stripped to nothing but the surreal, atmospheric, disorienting nightmare sequencing of suspiria. very little attempt is made to ground characters, most of the story and exposition is either inscrutable or incidental to the situations we’re actually watching, and instead the whole thing is just a series of setpieces—all otherworldly colored lightshows and slowburn anticipation of bloody, bodily harm—loosely strung together by the basic concept of “evil art deco building.” ultimately the setpieces…  
Christine 1983;8;  "Okay... show me."John Carpenter notoriously refused to go to Christine's premiere because, as he said, "when I go to premieres, something bad always happens". Well, there ain't nothin bad about ol' Christine. This is John Carpenter in studio mode: clean and focused with such sharply written, well-rounded characters and even more perfect set pieces to abet its solid story and unsettling static shots. While this doesn't quite reach the heights of Halloween, Escape from New Yorkor The Thing which…  
Halloween 1978;10; Man I needed this. So simple, still so effective.Still scary as FUCK. 
Aftersun 2022;8; A moving film about connection and the confines of one's memory/perspective. In terms of plotting, it's practically an anti-narrative hangout picture wherein nothing much happens. And as it progresses with each elongated moment, the film slowly becomes about the small and imperceptible signs, what’s left unsaid, and its emotional gut-punches are only revealed later. Like watching an old video to reminisce about something or that someone who is no longer with you on this earth. Understated, tactile cinema. 
Fall 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  At the end, her dad smiles and says "Let's get you home" and they walk toward his car, as if she wouldn't already be at the hospital for her incredibly infected leg and severe sunburns, and then in police custody for breaking a dozen state and federal laws and also probably a murder investigation.

Pearl 2022;8; Tbh Pearl deserved the part and a whole lot of trouble could’ve been prevented if they’d cast her smh 🤦‍♂️ So much better than X on every level it’s not even close. I’m putting it down to Mia Goth writing the screenplay this time around 😌 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;6;  Marvel is currently on fumes. I wasn't expecting this to be serious, but I was hoping for something funny. It wasn't. Though She-Hulk is a new addition to the MCU that appears odd in comparison to the other canon, this show is completely bankrupt of substance. It appears that they simply awoke and shot whatever came to mind. Even cameos from various famous characters couldn't improve the content. But don't get me wrong: it has an interesting story to tell, and…  
Halloween Ends 2022;2; Michael Myers appears to be a eunuch with low blood sugar while Haddonfield continues to be brimming with dumb, illogical, uninteresting characters.I can only hope that one day slashers will return to their straightforward roots, but the desecration of beloved franchises seems to be the entertainment industry's current favorite hobby, so I won't hold my breath. At least this particular trilogy of sequels is over. At the end of the day, we'll always have those golden oldies. 
Halloween 2018;6; The idiot in front of me took out his fucking phone and rated this 4/5 on LB halfway through the FUCKING world premiere of this movie.(It's pretty good btw)

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Beautiful, boring, cluttered, curious, messy, muddled, overlong, predictable, slow, underwhelming. 
Licence to Kill 1989;8;  1st John GlenBond goes Miami Vice and is really no worse for it. Despite not having the most high-power cast (Davi, Zerbe and McGill aren’t exactly marquee names), Licence to Kill succeeds thanks to a plot that manages to nicely balance the serious with the fantastic in a way that never tips over into absurdity or po-faced drama as with some of the Craig films. Skyfall is all well and good, but one can only watch so many moral…

Decision to Leave 2022;10;  I’m going to admit that this is my very first time watching a film directed by Park Chan-wook and if this is the quality that all his other films are at, then I have to catch up on his filmography right away. Decision to Leave is a 10/10, I’m gonna spoil the score straight away because this film was a pure masterpiece, it’s got so much going for it:The Best Romance of The Year The Best Editing of the…  
Raw 2016;10;  A HUNDRED UNSEEN HORRORS #73I had avoided this film for the last few years because even in horror I have a line and that line is usually non-zombie-inflicted and conscious cannibalism. However now after watching it (to see how it compares to BLOODTHIRSTY, a very cheap imitation I watched before this, see #72) I realize that there's so much more to it and I can see why it is award-winning. It captures the atmosphere of a terrifying first year…  
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  Happy Gay Christmas everyone!!So many things I could say that I almost want to just fuck it and write a one liner, but I can only bring myself to do that maybe once every other month at best so.It’s definitely better than the first one! Much gorier overall although somehow not as gory as I was expecting but I guess that’s because I imagined truly awful things after reading that people passed out at screenings. Except what those…

The Outside 2022;6; Husband of the yearRANKED: Spooktober 2022 
Pearl 2022;8;  “Pearl” knows its influences just like its lead character might wish she knew all her own angles.Ti West’s prequel to his own 80s slasher homage, “X,” “Pearl” could also be held as a post-prologue to the entire hagsploitstion movement. That gives a sort of self-aware irony from the outset, in that a lead role with a type usually taken by a ‘faded glory’ actress is, here, played by 20-something Mia Goth. Oh, the horror. If the world never knew…  
Prince of Darkness 1987;8;  "Suppose what your faith has said is essentially correct. Suppose there is a universal mind controlling everything, a god willing the behavior of every subatomic particle. Well, every particle has an anti-particle, its mirror image, its negative side. Maybe this universal mind resides in the mirror image instead of in our universe as we wanted to believe. Maybe he's anti-god, bringing darkness instead of light."I may only be in my mid-thirties, but it feels like I came to the…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Zur Videokritik: youtu.be/uFoovJAOKloNeulich bei Blumhouse Productions.

BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;10; No te mames no te mames, Bardo es cine a la verga potencia. Iñarritu haz lo que quieras con tus extras pero sigue haciendo cine por favor. La peli se estuvo acabando como media hora Y SEGUIA, en cada uno lloré. Cada plano es una maldita obra de arte, ojalá le hubiera entendido. 10/10 
TÁR 2022;10;  Tár is a character study as sprawling and sobering as Kenneth Lonergan’s Margaret, directed with icy precision by Todd Field and led by a knockout of a performance from Cate Blanchett. Although Field’s dialogue is engrossing, Blanchett doesn’t require words. Her performance is stunningly physical, a seamless blend of spontaneity and calculation, her body language often becoming the drama as well as supplementing it. As for the subject matter, while I somewhat flippantly sat down expecting a treatise on cancel…  
Black Adam 2022;4; best part is when they use cgi to make dwayne skinnier. dwayne "the pebble" johnson, if you will. 
Empire of Light 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   54/200Liz Truss had resigned about eight hours before I saw Sam Mendes’ Empire of Light. The increasing insanity and sitcom-worthy hackishness of British politics can’t be kept up with anymore than life in America can be meaningfully juggled. They hired a Donald Trump lookalike to boss them around because they felt like they were missing out on our reality, a never ending field trip to the broken glass factory. Our conspiracy hungry, gun hoarding right have turned every day…

Coraline 2009;8; While NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS Amy be his most popular film , Henry Selick’s 2-ish finest hours may be every darkly sumptuous frame and movement  in what I feel is his most complex and accomplished film. Every time I see it I feel like I discover a brand new detail. 
A Clockwork Orange 1971;10; genuinely upset I’ll never be able to watch this for the first time again 
Terrifier 2 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Art the Clown has to be considered a modern horror icon now. He's so much more sadistic and aggressive this time around. Not familiar with her but Lauren LaVera made for a complete badass of a final girl. Hope to see more of her in future projects.Terrifier 2 is an insanely brutal supernatural slasher! The gnarly practical effects, the set designs, the costumes, the tortuous kill scenes...just a perfect slasher film as well as overall horror film imho. The…

Barbarian 2022;8;  WOW! Barbarian surprised me as one of the most thrilling entertainments I've seen this year so far. I've heard all of the praise and I don't really ever get caught up in the modern day hype train we see for each passing movie (unless it's one I've been dying to see beforehand). After seeing this I can definitely understand why people have been raving about it for weeks. Thrills and chills are what we have here in this film. I…  
Black Sunday 1960;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberMario Bava broke onto the film scene with a film packed of characteristics that would later become a staple of Italian cinema, most notably the Spaghetti Western and the giallo, a genre helped to pioneer.The story, which is loosely based on the novel "VIY" (highly recommend the movie adaptation), is effective in its use of standard supernatural horror tropes like the vengeance of those who are falsely portrayed as victims but…  
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 2016;10;  Have been really enjoying the Andor Disney+ series and decided to revisit this. Seeing this in the theater for the first time at an advanced screenings is easily my favorite theatrical experience for a Star Wars movie. Going into the final battle on Scarif I had giant grin on my face that lasted through the closing moments of the film (and probably 1 or 2 days after).  According to Letterboxd it’s been about five years since I watched it last, but…  
Halloween Ends 2022;2;  What have they done?There's a line with classic franchises, that you just don't cross. Halloween Kills was a teasing little toe across that line. Halloween Ends is both feet leaping across it and gleefully dancing around the shitstorm it's left in its wake.I can take any number of shitty sequels, just as we had in the late 80's through to the mid 90's where a generic Michael Myers clone walks around slashing underwritten, obnoxious characters... give me one…  
Dead Poets Society 1989;10; "Neil's dead"does anyone have a gun??? 
Psycho II 1983;8;  A worthy extension even if is thematically and stylistically a polarisation of Hitchcocks cold classic.A who-dunnit with sympathy for the monster. Perkins reprisal as Norman Bates is essential cog that makes the whole machine work. 22 years on and his mannerist frame and nervous disposition make it an authentic sequel. There are some interesting high shots and open spaces that make the house feel vast and imposing.The problem is the script and pacing. It’s something you’d expect on…

Enola Holmes 2 2022;4; I hope Henry Cavill didn't quit the Witcher for Enola Holmes 3... 
Us 2019;8;  A strange jumble of creepy, cranky, crepuscular shenanigans strung together like a "hands across America" reunion.I'm torn about whether or not I like the overall story of Us. Part of me appreciates the film's originality and the subtle social commentary, however, I felt that, despite having an intriguing idea, the execution resulted in a disjointed story that felt a little scatterbrained. There were definitely suspenseful and horrifying parts of the film, but others felt over-explained or tropey. As a…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Colin Farrell gives a performance of warmth, melancholy and finally seething anger as Padraic. It's hard to fathom the behavior of his former best friend played with even more melancholy by Brenden Gleeson. The self-harm as a means of protection from someone who just wants his companionship was difficult for me to accept. Yet life is full of the bizarre and unthinkable so art should reflect it. I'm sure there's underlying symbolism regarding the Irish civil war, being fought on…

Top Gun: Maverick 2022;8; “Maybe so sir. But not today.” 
Class of 1984 1982;8; Class of 1984 might look like a cheesy b-movie from the outside but it actually plays out like a brutal AF exploitation flick. The (highschool) gang in this is so unbelievably ruthless. Seriously, there aren't many movies with antagonists this reprehensible (they come very close to Alex DeLarge and his Droogs). You hate them from the moment they are introduced.Because of its nihilistic tone I can't say this is a very fun movie. It does however deliver high quality exploitation kicks.Good times watching this with Michelle. 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  easily the highlight of this new trilogy, the only one that goes out of its way to try and not be a carpenter rehash, and also likely the best 'it's actually about trauma' horror film we've gotten in the past decade. the directing is kinda shit, the writing is definitely shit, but hell, at least this tries to do something original, tries to move beyond the michael myers 'mythos' and the general formula of slashers. i was coming in expecting…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Shapes will change. Not into anything good though. Evil has returned to Haddonfield for one last time, in the final entry of a trilogy that went from promising beginnings into a slap in the face to any fans of the franchise.There was hope. Even after the last film. One which was not for me at all. Something inside me believed this would turn things around, because it would need to deliver as a big send off, but it might…

Halloween II 1981;8; Dr. Loomis you are so bad at your job 
Scream 2 1997;10; i love this dumb ass white movie about some dumb ass white girls getting their white asses cut the fuck up 
Get Out 2017;8; the scariest moment in the movie was when the woman separated the milk from the cereal 
The Autopsy 2022;10; This one is easily the best of the anthology thus far. Directed by David Prior this story is intriguing, features some excellent camera work, gruesome effects work and chilling and unexpected ending. F. Murray Abraham gives an impressive performance. Above all else, though, the editing is extremely well done. It get’s a little exposition heavy at the very end, but aside from that I really loved this entry. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. F. Murray Abraham and Dustin Hoffman in All the President’s Men2. Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon in Sleepers 
Ran 1985;10; On this viewing, it occurred to me that this movie has essentially the same message as It’s a Wonderful Life, but the story is inverted. Instead of a poor man who discovers the meaning of true wealth after a lifetime of sacrifice, a rich man discovers the meaning of true poverty after a lifetime of ruthless self-interest. The fact that these are two of my favorite films is perhaps not a coincidence, and probably very telling of my tastes and personal beliefs. 
Prey for the Devil 2022;2; I’m sure I’ve seen this exact film 40 times now. This could easily go down to a 0.5/5 if Colin Salmons’ voice wasn’t so calming.VIDEO REVIEW HERE  
She Said 2022;10;  Ich habe den Artikel damals am Tag des Erscheinens gelesen und weiß noch, wie fassungslos mich der Text zurück ließ. Nicht weil ich sonderlich überrascht gewesen wäre - Weinstein galt bereits auf dem Zenit seiner Macht als maximal unangenehm, die Geschichte seiner Übergriffe in das Filmgeschehen stapelten sich bereits Mitte der Neunziger bis unter den Rand des Hollywood Signs. Schockiert hatte mich vor allem, dass der Mann jahrzehntelang walten und wüten konnte, dass seine Opfer zahllos gewesen sein müssen, aber…  
Aladdin 1992;10; The A Whole New World scene was so iconic. But I can't help but wonder and laugh if the lyrics below have a double meaning. “A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)I'm like a shooting star, I've come so farI can't go back to where I used to be (A whole new world)”Is it just me, or I just have a dirty mind? LOL! 
Pearl 2022;10; she came and she slayed (both quite literally) 
Black Adam 2022;6; I honestly didn’t hate this, however, I certainly didn’t like it. The final act pretty much saved it from being one of the worst releases this year. Unfortunately with a script like that, this is never going to get higher than a 2.5/5.FULL REVIEW HERE 
Till 2022;8;  DANIELLE DEADWYLER THE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!My head literally hurt from how hard I cried watching this, but to my surprise (and satisfaction), this was far from the “Black trauma porn” many were worried it would be from the first trailer. Writer/director Chinonye Chukwu treats this material with the tender thoughtfulness it deserves, truthfully honoring Mamie’s heartache, but sensitively showcasing her riveting rise as a major figure in the civil rights movement all the same. It’s a tricky tightrope…  
The Killing of a Sacred Deer 2017;10; me, drenched in sweat: where the fuck was the deer 
Fight Club 1999;10;  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of reviews for this classic. Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club. Now if you are reading this, then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless post is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend…  
Vada Chennai 2018;10;  An epic gangster drama that deals with themes of power-destiny-loyalty-deceit-revenge and stands out for its brilliant writing, engaging multiple character narrative, well researched detailing, excellent performances, fantastic music and masterful execution from Vetrimaran. The multiple sub plots helps it sustain the dramatic intensity all through, holding your attention right from start to end with solid twists and turns. Dhanush puts on a remarkable show with his restrained performance. It’s got a huge supporting ensemble in Ameer, Andrea, Samuthirakani, Kishore, Daniel…  
The Five Devils 2022;8; AFI 2022: film #8“could you live without her?”it’s giving mid-budget mid-january indie sci fi thriller, but better and frencher. i approached this viewing from more of a popcorn movie perspective, which allowed me to really enjoy the supernatural layers and not come at it too seriously. also, it contains my favorite sub-genre in all of cinema: surprise lesbians, and one of the best “random-homophbic-one-liners-from-a-child” of all time. thank you adele exarchopoulos for this much needed boost of seratonin. mmmmmm 
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;6; There is a really great story in there that could have made for a great film in the hands of a more capable screenwriter/director duo, but what we ended up with here is an OK made-for-tv movie with a wasted really good lead performance. Not great, not terrible. Basically, a Netflix original. Mila Kunis needs a new agent. 
Amsterdam 2022;4; **sigh**Bland and shallow. Characters I couldn’t care less about and Robert DeNiro phoning it in for a paycheck. What an absolute waste of a stellar cast. Christian Bale was so good he made everyone around him look like first year performing arts students. 
Grimcutty 2022;2; Is this a Dhar Mann Original horror film. 
The Descent 2005;8; this is a metaphor for women going onto discord for the first time 
Portrait of a Lady on Fire 2019;10; No spoilers but I didn’t breathe for the last few minutes of this movie 
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 2004;10; imagine how much better this franchise would have been if alfonso cuarón had directed all of it 
Zack Snyder's Justice League 2021;10;  A movie I truly wish I had the time to sit and write page after page on, because of how pleasurable it would be. Beyond it's sheer aesthetic density, it's genuinely dazzling how inventive the movie constantly is over its 4 hour runtime. It's a genuine marvel (no pun intended) of cinematic dexterity and imagination: so much of this movies most important sequences take place not in the plot proper but within dreams, visions of the past and future, hypothetical…  
The Worst Person in the World 2021;10;  Fuck it, here I go adding to the hype again.🤷‍♂️I can’t say I was emotionally ready for this HEAVY ass film, but it somehow harnesses that shitty gut feeling and man that never went away. The performances, characters, overall premise feel so real, relatable, and deeply effective. I’d say about maybe 45 mins in, I was completely lost in this story. Yeah there are other movies that touch on the same shit this does, but with these characters, the dialog they…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "THE BLACK PANTHER LIVES!"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, while mildly mid by Marvel movie standards, TOTALLY TRIUMPHS as both a tribute to the late, great Chadwick Boseman & a testament to the strength, courage, & persisting authenticity that Black Panther represents in the MCU. Had less capable filmmakers & less commanding actors been assigned to the original project, this sequel would've surely been a disaster. But instead, it works because of their tireless, relentless, & brilliant determination to bring Black Excellence to this franchise…   
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; something about the island whose entire geography is walls. the things we do to ourselvesfinally!! a serious man for irish people 
The People You're Paying to Be in Shorts 2022;10;  a case study in failure. the polar opposite of The Last Dance in that it refuses to market Michael Jordan as this larger than life basketball genius, revealing him to be an often cruel, hypocritical and exploitative capitalist like any other owner in the NBA. there are moments of phenomenal humour (everything with Boris is hysterical and Bois’ argument that Jordan should have come out of retirement at age 48 to salvage this team is a classic Jon moment) but…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  How is every movie from the trilogy so diffrent.First of all before I talk about Halloween Ends is how was the first one like the perfect sequel full of build up cool kills etc.. then the sequel was to much kills not enough story then this was absolutely completely diffrent type of movie with a Laurie strode  and Michael myers feature at the end.So this movie just totally didn’t have a clue what it wanted to be what…  
Moonage Daydream 2022;10; The most important thing I learned from this was that David Bowie really wanted everybody to know that he was a Capricorn

It 2017;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  those kids are not gonna make it to the sequel because of whatever disease they contracted from their blood pact  
American Psycho 2000;10;  Sorry about the length in advance.I watched this film a few years ago and thought, “I got it. He really isn’t Patrick Bateman. Big whoop.” I return to this and realize how little I knew. American Psycho is a masterpiece. It examines American society (specifically 80s Wall Street yuppies) in the most uproarious and horrific light possible. It’s dark and sardonic, but thoroughly entertaining. I shouldn’t be laughing at someone being killed or a related comment, but it absolutely…  
Slave of the Cannibal God 1978;8;  Sergio Martino's Slave of the Cannibal God might not be talked about in the same breath as Cannibal Holocaust but I would still consider it essential viewing for fans of these vile exploitation movies. It is an excellent jungle adventurer before the cannibal action* explodes on the screen in the final 20 minutes. Most of these movies contain a fair amount of animal cruelty and sadly SotCG is no different. It's nasty stuff. Luckily none of it was as harrowing…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8; When we left the cinema we looked into the bathroom and there was a man in a full Michael myers costume and he was following us and it was truly terrifying 
X 2022;8;  80"I will not accept a life I don't deserve."X stumbles into the Slasher sub-genre by initially observing their often moralistic methodology. With the setting of a backwoods rural nightmare and the context of an outsider creative team in the porn industry, it doesn't take long before X is going absolutely apeshit with the edit. From split-screens to harsh cuts between what's real and what's photographed, with the 'movie within a movie' offering a fantastical sense of titillation that…  
Enola Holmes 2020;6; if helena bonham carter went missing, i’d go looking for her too 
Coraline 2009;10; wtf is a mango milkshake 
Halloween II 1981;8; Michael Myers is said to be 21 by Dr. Loomis in the film, but then in the credits there is a credit for a 23 year old Michael Myers. I find this confusing, but also depressing. I find it depressing because whether he is 21 or 23 I am still older than Michael Myers, and he has accomplished way more in his life than I have. 
The Hole 1998;10; maybe the best aesthetic a movie has ever had 
The Munsters 2022;4;  Action!: Grinding With Rob ZombieOne of those flicks for which I had no hope. The trailer was terrible, and the reviews that followed were much worse. Despite this and my already low expectations, the movie still let me down.On the one hand, the production design and make-up are fine. In many ways, I can appreciate Zombie's goals and intentions. Roebuck is the film's best and brightest asset, but unfortunately the rest of the movie is a train wreck.…  
Barbarian 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Started off so-so and then just got dumber and dumberrr and dumberrrrrr and dumberrrrrrrrrrr. So sick of hapless horror films trying to feign subtext these days. This has zilch to say. Not on gender relations. Not on incest. Not on Airbnb safety. Not on gentrification. Not on dismissive policing. Not on cancel culture. Not on madness or mental health or living in the derelict margins of a dilapidated city (Detroit). So why tease? Just be fucking dumb and proud of…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; No one talk to me new marvel crush unlocked 🤭 I’m a Namor Apologist sorry not sorry 😅After  wanky vfx in she hulk and Thor 4 it’s nice to see stunning mcu visuals for the most part.I’m glad I didn’t see any spoilers because the twists and turns were awesomeIt’s not as good as the original for obvious reasons and at times it felt emotionally manipulative but it’s a top tier mcu flick regardless 2022 RANKED : boxd.it/hDUnW

Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; I’m writing this as I leave the world premiere and I’m fully leaving in awe because I truly believe it was better than the first. If you liked the first, you’ll love this sequel. It’s just as witty but even more charming and I know a few specific scenes will spark conversations. MBB you will always be famous. Here’s to seeing more Enola because I strongly feel like we will in the future 
Pontypool 2008;8;  this might very well be getting that canadian genre cinephile bump (i grew up about 25 minutes away from pontypool) but i do genuinely think "what if night of the living dead was a locked-in war of the worlds radio play starring kawartha lakes' howard stern?" is an amazing premise for a movie, and stephen mchattie is so good at doing the talk radio thing that it effectively carries it through the more derivative zombie movie elements. also helps that…  
Pearl 2022;8;  When Ti West released X earlier this year, it was a slam dunk of a surprise, a classy slasher that invoked the vibe of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and had some interesting themes around age and sex. I’ve finally been able to watch the surprise prequel film Pearl today and it’s another absolute slam dunk, the film follows the origin story of the titled character (played by Mia Goth in both this and X) as she tries to escape from her…  
Kantara 2022;4;  Before going in for the movie, I'd read rave reviews about how amazing the theatre experience was, and later about a few problematic aspects of the film. I usually try to avoid reviews and go in fresh for the film myself, but this time since I caught the film on the literal last day of the Kannada version show, I couldn't avoid the reviews and articles about the film. After watching the film, what bothered me the most was how…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10;  Park Chan-Wook continues his run of elegant and intricately crafted erotic thrillers with a tale of obsession and desire as seductive as the film's gorgeously presented images. Reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, this noir of need and romance fashions moments of pure cinematic bliss, while weaving a mystery of the most intriguing, but convoluted, nature.  Park has shed the ultraviolence and stylistic excesses of his early work without sacrificing his inclination to provoke. His tools for doing so are…  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;8; Titanic old lady voice: and it was…in fact…my Joker…anyone who rates this less than 3 stars but gave Spider-Man No Way Home more than 3 stars should have their right to an opinion REVOKED. some of y’all ain’t shit and it shows.it’s iconic, it’s for the girls, it’s Girlie Cinema and deserves to be seen and reviewed through that lens otherwise its brilliance won’t shine as bright.Harry Potter is a little boring bitch quivering in fear at the mere sight of the two Sofias and that’s on that. 
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  If HALLOWEEN (2018) is the film that was expected, and HALLOWEEN KILLS (2020) was the slasher stripped down to its most mean-spirited base, then HALLOWEEN ENDS is the "How does it go on?"It doesn't. My pal told me HALLOWEEN ENDS did a "METAL GEAR SOLID 2," and he wasn't lying, yet, I did enjoy how it boiled down to David Gordon Green's version of CHRISTINE, but with a William Shatner Mask in the place of the car. Plus, Green…

I mean just look at this film…It’s feckin’ mental!!! It’s so feckin’mental that it’s making me wonder if I’ve gone feckin’ mental. But no, I’ve not gone feckin’ mental. Not only have I not gone feckin’ mental, but I’ve ten fingers to prove that I’ve not gone feckin’ mental.

Top Gun: Maverick 2022;8; Yeah the flying is amazing and it has the most thrilling action finale I’ve seen in a blockbuster in years but honestly one of the most exciting things about this movie is that Tom Cruise finally made a movie that acknowledges he’s getting older

Barbarian 2022;8;   31 DAYS OF HORROR 2022 - Film 35 Tess arrives at her AIR BNB in a rundown suburb of Detroit. It's the only livable house in the area. When the lockbox doesn't have a key inside, she rings the bell and meets Keith. They have been double booked to the same house, and there are no local hotel rooms available so they agree to share the house and complain to the agency later. Thus begins Tess's decent into terror.

Bullet Train 2022;8;  I guess I expected less from the lack of summer buzz (or because I was in a hole of post production and missed it in theaters) but had a LOT of fun with this. A mix of SMOKIN ACES, any Guy Ritchie movie, a few Takashi Miike flicks & MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS remake with a healthy dose of sophomoric humor and clever script mechanics.Pitt was a breezy delight, almost as if “Floyd” from TRUE ROMANCE grew up, put…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; every bit of this feels so authentic and from the heart, so much pure passion in front of and behind the camera. Namor fucking rules, Ludwig’s score is INSANE, the action is absolutely top notch, and most of all I’m just really impressed with how thoroughly and expertly it explores all its themes. From the war with Talokan to the way it deals with the loss of T’Challa/Chadwick… only Coogler could pull all this off. 
Angel of Darkness 3 1996;6;  It’s been a while since I watched one of these and I was hankering for some low rent tentacle action.The lone survivor of the last film exists just long enough to expel the demon into a nurse then dies. Then we’re back to basics with a body-hopping lust demon raping nubile schoolgirls! If it ain’t broke don’t fix it I say.These films exist to have women writhe around with their breasts exposed as foam latex tentacles rub all…  
Barbarian 2022;8;  I imagine this will get some backlash cos it's in danger of being over-hyped, but if you have reasonable expectations (or better yet, no expectations), it will deliver. It's a bit like an old school ghost train ride at the funfair - goofy as hell, but still capable of giving you plenty of jolts along the way. It lives and dies by its accumulated reveals, and the direction of travel is gonna be just too silly for some to swallow,…  
Athena 2022;8;  One of those films that didn't pique my curiosity until a number of folks around here gave it a positive reception. Also, I've never seen Les Miserables, so I have no point of reference.Having said that, the film's technical achievements are remarkable. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the film was composed largely of ostensibly uncut takes, all of which were superbly executed and didn't feel too gimmicky as they were seamlessly woven into the narrative, giving the film…  
The Invitation 2022;4;  In the mythical words of Josh Hammond: "Ok... who's hungry?"While I can see why "Ready or Not" comparisons have been made, I don't find much of a connection between the two. This movie, which spends most of its time being serious and trying to convey a message in a rather forced way that lacks any form of nuance, could have used a lot more camp and a lot more fun with itself. The finest efforts of Emmanuel's cast and…  
Black Adam 2022;6;  God of War + God of Egypt + DC + The Rock + some Sandalwood like K.G.F: Chapter 2 + Gold + Brown + CGI³ + Devil Jin + Pace² + a beat'em up brawl frequency = Black Adam.

The Exorcist 1973;8; Scary, but less scary than heartbreaking, suffused with grief and guilt and dread, with the sense that there's no system truly prepared to combat madness or pain, there's only the trial and error, the compromise, of barely surviving them. 
The Ring 2002;8; the story of a woman who only has 7 days to analyze the meaning of an avant-garde experimental art film. just take a cinema studies class, girl!

Solita 2022;8;  "Solita" is a short independent effort written and directed by Carlos Diaz and starring Genesis Rosa. As it is intended on being short and simple within the driver of formalistic narrative efforts, its real purposeful merit is to be a test of sensory applications. Seemingly at first glance to have elements of the supernatural within haunting purpose, there is duality to the energy also within the natural, humanistic form. This is due to the evoking feeling that we all have…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  If this how they planned to end the Halloween franchise, then this long running horror franchise has went out with all the gravitas of a wet fart. I’ve been a lifelong fan of this convoluted and quality drifting franchise, John Carpenter’s original is one of my favourite films of all time, and I absolutely adored 2018, I even heavily enjoyed the divisive Halloween Kills, so it’s really painful to say that they ended this franchise with this dud. Obviously it’s…  
Speak No Evil 2022;6;  Woof, the third act of this goes off the rails so fast that it’s make or break for the whole film, and for me it was mostly break. I know it’s the point, but if you so pathetically and gutlessly accept what these characters do, especially as parents, you deserve it!!! The daughter is also too old, and the score kind of insists upon itself. I’m nitpicking - up until then, it’s a very well shot and executed slow burn…  
The Spiral Staircase 1946;8;  A voiceless woman finds herself pursued by a man in the shadows, while trapped in a household where every corner seems to hold a set of prying male eyes. Genre master Robert Siodmak’s noir “The Spiral Staircase” has a gaze as fixed on metaphor as its villain‘s stare is set on the work’s silent heroine. In “Staircase,” Dorothy McGuire stars as a mute maid confined to an early 20th century Vermont manor while a serial killer targeting the disabled hunts…  
Spider-Man 2002;8; Peter: Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city, he was trying to save it. That's slander.J. Jonah Jameson: It is not. I resent that. Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.Classic Jameson.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked8/10 
Men 2022;2;  alex garland has made three movies about women in a row and i can't help but find it weird that his entire conception of womanhood is just about being abused and traumatized. annihilation pivots on a scene where a character lists the various traumatic histories of each of the five leads. in this film, jessie buckley's harper isn't even a character at all. her entire persona comes through implication, the idea that we're supposed to side with her because of…

About Time 2013;10; The most unrealistic part is the fact that they were able to keep the time travel a secret all that time, there’s zero chance I’d keep it a secret - I’d be telling everyone I knew the second I found out 
Causeway 2022;8; this film really cut so deep. two phenomenal performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry along with an incredibly nuanced script. the acting throughout the film was extremely quiet, poignant and subtle, it feels like there is something trying to claw out from under the surface in both Jen and Brian’s characters (in the best way.) I'm so happy that Jen is going back to her roots and telling important, emotional stories like this!2022 RANKED 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Avatar: The Way of Water was all I could think about during this movie. There was a lot of things I liked about Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Individual moments, the score, some action sequences, visuals, etc. However, the movie as a whole didn't quite completely work for me. Black Panther is one of my favorite films in the MCU and Wakanda Forever is a pretty big step down from that. Ryan Coogler had his hands tied because of some extremely unfortunate circumstances (RIP Chadwick Boseman) and he did what he could. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  I'm a freaking mess rn y'all 😭😭😭My gosh, Shuri's journey in this film was incredible. The story beats her down HARD, and it was freaking heartbraking. As the film moves forward and she loses more and more, she also loses more of herself. Every "big moment" towards becoming who she's meant to be was bittersweet, it was like a victory that felt almost like another loss, because she was so on edge, so consumed by anger and grief, she…  
Palm Springs 2020;10; everything is so perfectly understated the scene where they sleep together for the first time is literally one of the realest most beautiful moments ever like he just wants to LOOK AT HER AND REMEMBER IT HELLOOOOOOO I WANT TO CRY MY EYES OUT this is such a fucking awesome movie nothing matters and everything matters and being in love is awesome

Which is to say, I didn't really realize just how much the pandemic and its consequences fucked me and my life while living it, living in its 'new normal' that tricked me into thinking that this is simply how my life always was and that this…  
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 1986;10;  In a seeming continuance of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (1974), the 80's became the next opportunity to release a sequel to appease a new rise generatic horror sequels. As the race of this trend began really at the beginning of the decade between the arms race that is "Halloween" (1978) and "Friday the 13th" (1980). As "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984) snuck into the mix as "Halloween" went on hiatus for a bit, the strength of series-based horror was…

Hot Fuzz 2007;8; Celebrating my 20th birthday in style by watching Hot Fuzz for the first time…what the fuck this movies great! It’s such a vibrant, goofy movie, full of love for the cast of ridiculous characters and it’s hilarious premise. Wright and Pegg are magnificent together, beating anything I’ve seen them do and the rest of the stacked cast do a great job at filling out the rest of the village, bringing some truly amazing characters to life perfectly. I’ve been sceptical to watch this for years but hell, now I can’t wait to rewatch it, a truly great time indeed.

Morbius did not just eclipse Jack and Jill as the greatest film ever released by Sony Pictures, nor did it just obliterate Battlefield Earth as the medium's greatest achievement.

Deadline at Dawn 1946;6;  Hollywood never knew a man who could write such a nasty line into a screenplay as could Clifford Odets. Maybe one other man, but that man was Billy Wilder. Unfortunately, there was also hardly a director who could very well wrangle the complex intellect in Odets’ text into something resembling a cohesive motion picture. Harold Clurman, the man behind the camera of noir “Deadline at Dawn,” was not one of those directors. Much like Odets’ scripts, Clurman worked better on…

See How They Run 2022;4;  In the era of murder mystery this is probably the least enjoyable.With releases like Knives out,Murder on the orient express,Bodies Bodies Bodies they all brought something new to the table however this was massively unsatisfying. During the first hour I was finding myself a little board with a few smiles from Saorise Ronan as the best part of the movie with some one liners however the plot seemed to thicken and maybe have a little twist on the story…

Just as the novel and the stage play before so bravely dared to ask, so does James Whale's classic piece of monster cinema in whether man is God in his scientific ability to create something from nothing or is he but a monster himself believing that he is God and thus holding his creation up to the mirror of himself and…

Martin Mcdonagh,Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are the perfect trio for the best comedy’s and is definitely up on par with in Brudges. Their is nothing in this movie I can put to fault, the directing and cinematography were beautiful in every scene and the entire experience was transfixing. Everyone in this…

The Shining 1980;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Saw this one in the theater last night, great experience. Underrated how funny this movie is. For half the movie, Nicholson is in full bozo mode (TM LexG), having more fun as an actor than anyone is ever allowed to in a Kubrick film.

The Fabelmans 2022;8;  "Is he lying?""No, he’s telling a story."Short one-liners and moments like this, which shed light on the ideas that have shaped Spielberg’s approach to storytelling, fill his most personal film to date. A variety of emotions are captured effortlessly in The Fabelmans. With this semi-autobiographical love letter to the movies, Spielberg illustrates how cinema has the unique ability to capture love simultaneously with pain, laughter simultaneously with despair, and hope with fear. For better or worse, Spielberg’s work has always…  
Terrifier 2 2022;6;  WOW Damien Leone can write! The first Terrifier had a really low budget so I won't too harsh. But it was meaningless, forgettable, not fun, and it was a nightmare despite is really short time. With the increase in the budget, everything is much better in this, but almost 2.5 hours? While making 2 hours a horror film is already a risk, the film, which is 'torture porn' by prolonging the time here, tortured us slightly, but I am mostly…

Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; Had a lot more fun with this than I was expecting to. It’s slightly better than the original and more focused although some of the twists could be spotted from a mile away.Henry and Millie’s chemistry is perfect.Was expecting more from Louis Partridge though and where did the other Holmes brother disappear to?All in all it’s not a groundbreaking film but it’s doesn’t have noticeable distracting flaws it’s just pure escapist entertainment 👌2022 RANKED : boxd.it/hDUnW 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; It has its moments, but it's ultimately bland and overlong. Even the fight scenes and CGI were like the other phase 4 films. 
See How They Run 2022;6;  Quite a fun filled whodunnit mystery comedy that’s held together by the delightful chemistry between Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan. It has a few lags n has less to offer when it comes to suspense factor, but makes up for it with consistent chuckles and solid performances, keeping the show rolling n engaging. The finale was good. Technically, the movie is solid with some of its frame-editing choices carrying heavy Wes Anderson vibe. The crisp runtime, effortless wittiness and enjoyable…  
My Policeman 2022;8; a beautifully made tragic story, and the end was nice. 
Girl, Interrupted 1999;8;  A film that shows unequivocally that Angelina Jolie is capable of being a fantastic actress. Her enthralling performance in this film is riveting, anchoring the film all the way to the end, displaying all these ranges of emotions, but more significantly, selling you on her coldness and sociopathy, turning her in this great antagonist that you keep rooting for even after that suicide scene. Winona Ryder and the rest of the ensemble are no slouches, and what we have here…  
The Final Destination 2009;4; a genuinely bizarre amount of cg and racism going on in this one.

Entergalactic 2022;10; “love is a motherfucker, boys. it'll find us all. it'll hurt us all. but goddamn it, it's the only thing that'll save us all. if you got it, hold on to it” 
Last Night in Soho 2021;8; this is crack for all you “i was born in the wrong generation” bitches 
Saw 2004;8; It is WILD that this movie kicked off a whole “torture porn” wave of horror when it’s really just a clever little thriller with no actual torture 
Interview with the Vampire 1994;10; louis: lestat i'm leaving youlestat: i'm pregnant and it's yours 
Practical Magic 1998;8; sometimes things dont make sense but then other times theres two stevie nicks songs on the soundtrack of a movie about two witch sisters killing a man 
TÁR 2022;10; fell immediately in love with this. a film where purpose and intent are not just themes being presented but also the very nature in the way it’s crafted. i love films where the character essentially is the movie, and that’s an enormous responsibility to place on a lead actor. there are few who can take on that task, but leave it to cate blanchette to tackle it with poise and precision, and where i can say without recency bias talking is one of her best, if not her single best performance. one of the most astonishingly directed and achingly made films in recent years. 
Do Revenge 2022;10; eleanor and drea are to me what the joker and harley quinn are to straight people 
Titane 2021;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  gay son AND thot daughter  
Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;8; Halloween:Dude in a mask terrorizes a neighborhood Halloween 2: Dude in a mask terrorizes a hospital Halloween 3:Toy manufacturer creates masks that kill children when an annoying commercial plays a jingle which triggers the mask to crush their heads and release bugs and snakes. The manufacturer also has coins that create lightsabers to instantly kill adults.I am pretty sure the pitch to get the third movie made is "What if we drop Michael Myers and just go fucking wild" to which I appreciated because this chaotic mess was really fun. 
The Shining 1980;10; Jack Nicholson delivers arguably the funniest performance of his career within one of the scariest horror movies of all time… YET IT STILL SOMEHOW MANAGES TO WORK. THIS MOVIE FREAKIN ROCKS. 
Pearl 2022;8; I liked X but didn’t feel overwhelmingly passionate about it. I’m glad to say that I have much stronger feelings for Pearl. Less overtly violent than its predecessor, though not lacking for gruesome thrills, Pearl is a film of both homage and ingenuity, driven by a captivating sense of unadulterated style. It helps that Mia Goth is an absolute force of nature and is the main reason why Ti West’s latest is able to disturb, amuse and entertain. Extra points for an equal parts fascinating and disconcerting final shot. 
Terrifier 2016;4; the level of gore that every horror movie needs really

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Namor’s still punching M’Baku  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4;  First act was actually somewhat emotionally effective and I like how patient the pacing and buildup was to the action, a lot of shots in this are  long takes which I find the effort to be more admirable, and obviously this was made at a time where the entire cast and crew were mourning and in sorrow so there is a strong sense of pathos throughout the film. Where it all goes wrong is all the usual MCUisms: the pro-colonization,…  
The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946;8;  ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜᴇᴅ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴄᴄᴄ.There are moments in The Postman Always Rings Twice during which Lana Turner as Cora is a little too mannered — a little too focused on projecting big, lasting versions of the specific emotions her character is experiencing. But that's the case only if one focuses just on the film's surface. When one looks below, and recognizes the fact that Cora herself is constantly performing, Turner's embodying of the character becomes a brilliantly complex one, constructed of…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  As we all learned from Randy in our Scream 2 Film Theory class it's that "[...] sequels are inferior films." Except, sometimes they aren't. I'd have argued that point with Randy in 1997 then and I would even now in 2022. Not that sequels haven't greatly tarnished almost the entirety of certain genres and the reputations of so many first films as well (we now have streaming we can thank for this as well), but sometimes they hit just all…  
Red Eye 2005;8; if cillian murphy character bad then why sexy 
Near Dark 1987;8;  Even though the main romantic relationship is dry as fuck, the rest of the film rips. I wrote about Bill Paxton’s tremendous performance for Criterion. Excerpt: “Like a shark constantly in search of the smell of blood in the water, he’s always in motion. He jumps and cackles and dances with a sharp energy that speaks to his never-ending hunger. For him, pleasure is the principle and the point. This vampire’s effervescent chaos communicates a thrilling indifference toward propriety and…  
Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story 2022;10; episode 6 is truly the most heartbreaking episode of tv ive ever seen. 
See How They Run 2022;8; Is it weird to call a whodunnit movie delightful? Like the body count in this is high and yet its tone is on a near Paddington level.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower 2012;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ah yes this movie about privileged rich kids dealing with their meaningless shallow problems like the lingering trauma of childhhood sexual abuse, dealing with grief over your best friend's suicide, being openly gay and receiving brutal homophobia and dismissal from the man you love, being cheated on and abandoned in relationships and dealing with depression and crippling social anxieties by making connections and bonding with people, to find some form of solace and beauty in a world filled with such…   
The Florida Project 2017;10; this is the first time willem dafoe has not looked like the human embodiment of evil he was truly willem dafriend in this 
Trick 'r Treat 2007;10; Damn, this was a lot of fun. Love the intersecting storylines. Gives the film a much more cohesive feel than your typical anthology film. So awesome to see Brian Cox, Dylan Baker, and Anna Paquin in this. One of those films I have no idea why J waited so long to finally watch it. Worth adding into your annual spooky season rotation. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 11. Dylan Baker and Kevin Bacon in Planes, Trains and Automobiles

Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; Enola will say it's a game,Then people ask her last name.She'll try to catch,Look for the match,Before the case goes up in flame. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; Aggressively mediocre. Much like Joker, the real life controversy surrounding this film is far more interesting than the film itself. Florence Pugh is great, she deserves to lead a better film. Harry Styles has some of the most laughably bad line deliveries of the year but that didn't ruin the film if I'm being honest, more of a distraction.I just wish the story was more compelling because I couldn't connect to it at all. It ended up feeling very lifeless for a psychological thriller.

Wendell & Wild 2022;6;  Every so often, you come across a film with such memorable side characters that your first instinct upon the roll of the credits is "Damn, they really should've made a movie about them, instead!" Henry Selick's long-awaited return to stop-motion, Wendell & Wild, is one such film, and the memorable side characters deserving of their own film are none other than... Wendell and Wild. The choice for Selick and co-writer Jordan Peele (who also voices Wild) to name the film after…

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  "Man is a beast."Edward Berger's version of All Quiet on the Western Front is a spellbinding nightmare reminding us of the horrors of war. It's more direct and experiential than Erich Maria Remarque's masterful novel or the Lewis Milestone's incredible 1930 adaptation of the material, both of which focus more on the idealism of the young German men and how it is shattered by the reality of combat on the Western Front in WWI. Berger wastes little time plunging…

The Spiral Staircase 1946;8;  ENGLISH below"The Spiral Staircase" beginnt mit einer großartigen Eröffnungssequenz, in der ein Psychopath sein Opfer durch einen Spalt im Kleiderschrank beobachtet, bevor er es tötet. Das Motiv der weit aufgerissenen Augen des Stalkers, das sich im Laufe des Films mehrmals wiederholt, ist brillant und wirklich unheimlich, ebenso wie die gelegentlich subjektive Kamera, die uns sehen lässt, was der Mörder sieht. Und das in einem Film aus dem Jahr 1946!"The Spiral Staircase" ist ein wunderbar altmodischer, gotischer Horrorfilm, der…

Possession 1981;8;  Recommended by Hunter Dean, and kind of seconded by Michael and zerdy, I can finally say I've seen this one and excuse my language but what the fuckery fuck just happened. I need to know what went through their minds to make something like this. I couldn't stand Anna and Mark's antics as well as their unhealthy relationship so that means their performances were on point, Isabelle Adjani standing out above everyone else. Plot wise is great, innovative without a doubt,…

The Autopsy 2022;10; I challenge Netflix to let David Prior make what ever he wants for the rest of time. 
Black Adam 2022;8; A bit of an all over the place mess but I still actually really enjoyed it. Dwayne Johnson is just so damn likeable no matter what he does. Plenty of carnage and action. Switch your mind off blockbuster fun. Also, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a superhero suit tighter than the one on Noah Centineo. 
The Ritual 2017;8; Shoutout to whoever recommended me this in my TikTok Live today. It was an absolute delight.We occasionally fall into horror cliches, but The Ritual still proves to be a haunting and paranoid experience, providing effective and creative horror with decently compelling characters. 
Home Alone 1990;8; Instead of churning out yet another knockoff sequel for Disney+ they should make a feature-length version of Angels With Filthy Souls. I’ve wanted to see that movie since 1990.(Also: Hope Davis is the French ticket agent? What?!?!)

The Lost City 2022;8;  Today I chose to watch an adventure comedy released in this year.It’s probably influenced by Romancing the Stone.It’s about a writer that without knowing how, she starts to be the main character of her own adventure, an adventure called life, or Indiana Jones and the Lost City.This movie has a normal premise, it’s nothing new. There are some interesting characters and it has a good pacing.Besides apparently looking like a dull movie, it’s more than that.…

Spider-Man: No Way Home 2021;2;  what a plastic, fake, tasteless kiddie menu of soulless fast food. McDopey with meatless mass production. unsavoury flat and flavourless, with missing out on salt and pepper this mess just starts.i guess i've been way to lenient with the two former outputs of the arachno / anti-anarcho boy.this is dumbed down to the point of irritating dullness. pseudo meta-allusions and meta-meta-jokery doesn't make an actual movie. just a delivery fan service brought right in front of your door…  
Breaking 2022;8;  Apparently someone watched "Dog Day Afternoon" and "John Q" too many times.But seriously, it's nice to see Boyega getting his due and establishing himself as a formidable performer after being criminally wasted in Star Wars along with the rest of the cast. This picture aims to be a character study more than a thriller, making the performances all the more important. Thankfully, Boyega does a fantastic job aided by a simple but effective script that allows for numerous dramatic…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6;  ”You’re just a man in a Halloween mask. What are you gonna do now?”The Man. The Myth. The Legend… ENDS 🤔David Gordon Green has got some kind of hutzpah.

He knew it would not only be divisive, but he knew the loyalists would not just hate the film but hate him in the process. And he did it anyway.The…  
The Return of the Living Dead 1985;10; Linnea Quigley naked, drenched in acid rain dancing on a gravestone openly wishing a bunch of zombies would start biting and eating her alive is a level of partying I can only strive for. 
Freaky Friday 2003;10; La película perfecta. Esto le gana a todo.Supremacia Lindsay Lohan y Jamie Lee Curtis por siempre. No puede existir nada mejor que Viernes de Locos 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; I was wheeze-laughing through most of this. My throat hurts a bit still. The film totally commits to the bit and doesn't intend to be anything else. Goddamn is this funny. I'm seeing mixed reactions from folks, but this is the hardest I've laughed at a movie in at least 10 years. It really worked for me. Felt good to laugh that much. 
Ocean's Eleven 2001;10; I was just telling my neighbor that Jack Nicholson should, and this is what I said to my neighbor, “give up his ‘98 academy award to this film, because this movie Oceans Eleven is As Good As It Gets!” He (neighbor) laughed and agreed! 
Black Adam 2022;6; not gonna lie during the early scenes where black adam is just fucking guys up i almost thought i was gonna come out liking this. it’s really not good but as these go it’s far from as bad as it can get. sort of funny that this studio threw snyder in the trash only to make a movie that’s actually textually about what snyder haters think his movies are, ie that sometimes you gotta kill guys and be kind of evil with it to do good. i even didn’t hate a dwayne johnson performance for once! maybe collet-serra isn’t lost to us forever.

Rosaline 2022;8; obsessed with satirical modern retellings please can we get kaitlyn dever in everything 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;4;  Very generous yet peculiar gesture by Cannes to award the Palme D’Or to Parasite again. Though honestly, for a while I thought I’d accidentally started watching Don't Look Up 2. That summarizes a bit how I feel. Credit where credit is due, the film is rather well directed, occasionally beautiful to look at, and the cast does a rather stellar job with what they’re given. There are also some genuinely hilarious moments and some very clever gags (though brought down…

Black Panther 2018;8; Ngl. The shot where Killmonger is about to sit on the throne and how it start from being upside down before twisting it back to normal? That’s the coolest shit ever. Can’t wait see what Ryan has in store for the sequel (which I wont see till like early next week due to me being busy all weekend and such, but oh well). 
Little Miss Sunshine 2006;10; Damn this was cute.So happy I saw this, I always remembered seeing this at video stores growing up and never watching it because I wasn’t into movies like this but man have I been missing out. This was amazing it had comedy sadness and a great story.Does Steve Carell have more movies like this and The Way Way Back? If so please let me know what they are and if not I really hope he does more. 🥰 Ahhh and Toni Collette please just continue being you.

Let the Right One In 2008;10; Wow, I really really loved this. A grounded and realistic yet incredibly tender vampire story. Absolutely loved it’s inclusion of the many aspects of classic vampire lore while keeping the focus on the characters first. I’m about as close to a 5-star rating as I get on a first watch. Completely and pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 31. Peter Carlberg and Alexander Skarsgård in Trust Me2. Alexander Skarsgård and Sam Rockwell in Mute3.

The Innkeepers 2011;4;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now Scariest part of the film was when I looked down for a second then looked back up and saw Lena Dunham.Ti West my man, there’s a stark difference between a slow burn horror film and a film where nothing fucking happens until the wet fart it calls the climax. At least House of the Devil occasionally broke up it’s monotony with a quick glimpse at something spooky, this is so abhorrently dull for…  
The Munsters 2022;2; This movie blew dick... and that's about as respectful as I'll get.1 star strictly for the production design. I didn't even remotely smile once or even chuckle ever so slightly. I haven't seen acting this bad and characters this lifeless since M. Night's After Earth. This movie makes Halloween Ends look like a Best Picture nominee. I hope everyone has a nice day, except the cast and crew of this film. 
Black Adam 2022;8; the sickest PS3 cutscene of all time. if this was shot in 60 frames per second, I would be championing this like it was my first born son. 
Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 2022;8; contrary to popular belief, the crocodile is not cgi. a real crocodile ate shawn mendes and they just decided to make the best out of a bad situation.

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;2; Walk away, that's right, Hulk. You know why I didn't take the job? 'Cause it's too. SMALL! I don't care about it! It's nothing to me, it's a bacterium! I travel in worlds you can't even imagine! You can't conceive of what I'm capable of! I'm so far beyond you! I'm a massive person in human clothing! LIGHTNING BOLTS SHOOT FROM MY FINGERTIPS! 
They Won't Believe Me 1947;8;  What is the root of all corruption: lust, or money? Which came first - the chick, or the nest egg? This question, of what first blackens a man’s heart, is at the core of “They Won’t Believe Me,” a noir scripted with such genius, that it stands amongst the best written entries in its genre. To call it Hitchcockian in its able maneuvering of various twists and turns in plot is far from excessive praise. Its producer, Joan Harrison, penned…  
Xanadu 1980;4;  A notorious flop in its day, Xanadu is firmly an artefact of the late 70s what with its gaudy fashions, dodgy PowerPoint-esque scene transitions and the fact that roller-skating seems to be one of the only methods of transport in this world (I don’t know if anyone ever kept a tally, but this probably holds some kind of record for it in one movie, like the scene where—for some reason—rather than getting in a car that’s giving him a lift…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Black Panther Wakanda Forever had real pressure to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor. And also, of course, to honour Chadwick Boseman.And to be honest, it works really well for the most part. Chadwick Boseman is really honoured and celebrated. Also, the cinema was completely full and during all the sad scenes it was as quiet as I have ever experienced...also sometimes you could hear people crying and I think almost the whole cinema had tears in their…  
Electra Glide in Blue 1973;10;  In an overly lit interior room with white walls to match, Robert Blake's character of John Wintergreen takes potshots at a poster of "Easy Rider" (1969) hanging on the wall. While this scene is presented as the film "Electra Glide in Blue" is already completed partially through and is a quick scene at that, it showcases a bit of the face valued tone that the film presents itself at, a reversal of mentality of "Easy Rider". Now the phrase "face…

Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8;  "What happened here?"This should not work at all. Taken at face value, this should be obnoxious at the bare minimum. And yet, though this film would probably end up being a wrong answer to an obvious $100 question on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" because of its silly three-pronged title, this horror-esque whodunnit trapeze act somehow works and this lies strictly with the women in front and behind the camera. Director Halina Reijn, screenwriter Sarah DeLappe, original story…  
The Stranger 2022;8;  Breathe in the clean air, and breathe out the blackness.The Stranger is a dark, sparse film with two incredible lead performances. It manages to keep the viewer on a knife’s edge without drawing a drop of blood. Sean Harris is phenomenal as Henry Teague, a murder suspect befriended by Mark, an undercover cop played by the increasingly impressive Joel Edgerton. Most of The Stranger is encased in grey shadow and darkness (even scenes in broad daylight don't feel particularly bright)…  
Host 2020;10;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now For a film that’s boiled down to “a found footage zoom call” this fucking ripped.This is the sort of film that’s packed with jumpscares and loud noises and it earns every single one of them. Because the tension is so quickly and effectively built up until it’s palpable and it never tones it down. Those jumpscares would not be nearly as effective if they weren’t accompanied by the almost nauseating stress the film…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely ageing more gracefully than the Halloween franchise, but this is still great in a kinda goofy way.

The only word that ever comes to mind whenever attempting to recall or recollect what Jaws is as a film and how I personally feel about the film. Spielberg's first blockbuster is unlike any other to grace the big screen. Jaws is full of tension, dialogue heavy, and has minimal action. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and company are exceptional as well.Adapted from a novel I have yet to read,…

Bones and All 2022;8;  Children inherit their parents’ eyes, their hair color, their skin, their blood. But they also inherit their parents’ diseases, addictions, and violence. Occasionally, they even inherit their parents… cannibalism. Luca Guadagnino’s newest film, “Bones and All,” dwells in the realm of movie monster perhaps lorded over by “The Shining’s” Jack Torrence. There dwell not just monsters of the mind, but of our own blood, so hungry, they devour us from the inside. They are horrors of our own heart, pumping…  
Scream 1996;10; ghostface could never get me because i don't ever answer the phone 
Speak No Evil 2022;8;  The Danish director's latest film is an absolutely unabashed take on the art of nihilism of Michael Haneke with a little touch of Lanthimos' awkwardness.It's not surprising that so many people disliked this movie. All of the characters in this film are unlikeable. They are the types of people you want to see suffer. Until the very end, at least. Certain twists in the final act reveal who is the greater villain, and I found myself sympathizing for the…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  An utter delight at the beginning, The Banshees of Inisherin also has a despondency around its edges that grows like a shadow as the movie proceeds—it’s like Waking Ned Devine with a three-day beard. Set on the small Irish island of Inisherin in 1923, where gunfire and explosions from the Irish Civil War can be heard over the waves, the movie centers on the suddenly defunct friendship between Pádraic (Colin Farrell), a young, easygoing herdsman who lives a simple life…

The Father 2020;8; A film from the perspective of someone with dementia - is truely heartbreaking to watch. I still need some time to process, but Sir Anthony Hopkins and the beautiful score made this movie truely a gut wrenching experience. If there was a way to protect my memories & stop me from ageing, I’m subscribing.  
Barbarian 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  "i don't believe in the glorification of murder. i do believe in the empowerment of women!" - me defending the mother  
Barbarian 2022;8; On a scale between (1) 'Sensible' and (5) 'Coco Bananas' on the Smart Decisions Matrix 2.0™️, Tess scored a rather disappointing 'you deserve everything you get' 
Pearl 2022;8;  Em algum sentido é um filme diferente do X, já que parte desse estudo de personagem pra propor algo mais intimista, mas ao mesmo tempo segue um caminho igualmente old school e gráfico quando lida com as mortes e outras possibilidades performáticas.Na verdade é um filme até mais arriscado porque aqui o Ti West precisa encontrar um certo equilíbrio entre o slasher gráfico e a confusão psicológica da protagonista. Com certeza a Mia Goth foi fundamental nisso tudo. Além…  
Pearl 2022;10;  All I want is to be loved. I’m having such a hard time without it lately.Pearl is a unique portrait of a personified desire and ambition to be someone, to escape from the mundane life that tightens around our necks and the need of love and admiration we so long for. A character study that’s so intrinsically disturbing, yet is juxtaposed by the production design that gives it such a stylish look in glorious technicolor we cannot shy our eyes…  
Armageddon Time 2022;6; James Gray really needed to get this off his chest, didn't he? good thing if you're that big to do a small cute autobiographical pic in Hollywood. America you beautiful, America you ugly. 
Terrifier 2 2022;2; This is the film equivalent of "guys, let's start a podcast. We could, like, actually do this!" 
Resurrection 2022;8; Imagine being the poor intern that has to stand there and listen to Rebecca Hall’s demented eight minute monologue and then go home and pretend everything’s fine 
Bullet Train 2022;8;  You know what, it’s an original, ambitious action comedy that has VERY consistent tone and pacing, actual themes (i mean, they’re definitely there), looks good, has tight action, occasional early Guy Ritchie vibes, and an excellent cast who all came to play. Is it kind of a mess? Yes. Do the jokes always land? God no. Was I getting sick of Brad Pitt’s character? A little! Did I learn too much Thomas the Tank Engine lore? Maybe! But god dammit…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8; Letterboxd Pro members vs regular Letterboxd users 
X 2022;8; Nothing scarier than horny old people

American Psycho 2000;8; patrick bateman: murder im okay with, but i draw the line at anti-semitism 
It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown 1966;10; No matter how much I think I’ve memorized this wonderful special, there are always more jokes about legal terms and suing people than I remembered. 
Babylon 2022;10; is it too late to ask damien chazelle to reshoot this entire movie again with miles teller in brad pitt’s role 
Falling for Christmas 2022;4; Es lo más cursi, más cliché, más olvidable, más mal actuado más pelicula navideña para comenzar con la temporada. Me costo algo terminarla y se me olvidó todo en cuanto acabo pero es el comeback se Lindsay Lohan y quiero apoyarla!Espantosa película pero no la sufres para nada, es mega inofensiva y súper navideña. Ruido de fondo Perfecto mientras armas tu árbol de navidad 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Wakanda Forever is the best MCU project since Avengers: Endgame.I went in with high expectations yet Ryan Coogler was able to exceed those high expectations. Wakanda Forever is the first MCU film in as long as I can remember that has a plot deeper than just a standard comic book movie and handles tough topics like grief, mourning, and loss beyond just the surface level.Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright stole the show for me with some of the…  
Giallo in Venice 1979;6;  Giallo in Venice. More like Genitalia in Venice. Genitali a venezia. The threadbare plot is really just an excuse to hang a skin flick on. After the initial murder of Fabio and Flavia is established (he was knifed and she was drowned) and the incredibly laid back, mustachioed Inspector de Pol has done some emphatic hand gesturing on the phone to his boss, we begin to learn more about the murder victims.We're treated to an extensive flashback sequence, establishing…  
V/H/S/99 2022;8; bad news, this movie doesn’t make a lick of sense if you haven’t seen the other 98...............(Okay, the movie’s out now, so I’m amending this goofy-ass dad joke to say: solid entry. The bad entries aren’t all that bad, they’re just Flying Lotus-y, which is to say Incredibly Fucking Weird and Sort Of Incoherent. That’s okay though, this series should be allowed the freedom to let artists go cuckoo bananas.Conclusion: Maggie Levin and the couples Winter undefeated, corpse munching and demon punching.) 
Joker 2019;2; if you’ve never swam in the ocean then of course a pool seems deep. 
The Exorcist 1973;10; This review is based on a true story.Last night a human being watched this stoned and almost had a heart attack from fright. 
Barbarian 2022;8; Absolutely loved Barbarian. A deranged, intense, funny and smartly written horror film that never goes in the direction you expect it to. What's great about film is it constantly reinvents itself and the way it subverts horror tropes by playing directly into them is really masterful. The casting choices are pitch perfect and smart. That measuring tape bit might be the funniest scene I've seen all year.Go in knowing nothing about it! 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; The Western Front is All Quiet,But diplomants might deny it.With talks of peace,Fighting can cease,If they can only just try it. 
Westworld 1973;8;  For $1,000 per day, an adult amusement park company called Delos claims to offer 'the vacation of the future' with a choice of three worlds to live in, Medieval World, Roman World, and Westworld. Westworld is a wild west themed stay, where highly advanced androids play the parts of it's citizens. Two friends, looking for a thrill, elect to vacation in Westworld. What starts out as a fun adventure quickly turns dangerous when the robots get infected with a mechanical…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;6; Colin Farrell: close ur eyes broBrendan Gleeson: ok broColin Farrell: wat u see broBrendan Gleeson: nothing broColin Farrell: that's my world without u broBrendan Gleeson: bro... 
Girl in the Picture 2022;8; One of the best documentaries on Netflix, despite its convoluted narrative structure, so I got lost several times. Still, from beginning to end this is pretty riveting as you watch this f—- up mystery unravel, a mystery that highlights just how rotten people can be.All in all, although, like many of these documentaries on the platform, there are plenty moments that feels like filler with the goal of stretching the length, this is an great documentary with some really good yet tragic twists.TODAY SCHEDULEThe Shortest DayThe Monk of MonzaThe Most Hated Man On The InternetGirl In The Picture 
Black Adam 2022;2;  What a sparkly fried turd this was. Bloated and force-fed empty calories. Saturated to the brim with action sequences and one-liners which all fall flat, a whole jumbled world in green screen, and the dryest robotic characters... Even the one who's seemingly straight out of Phantom of the Paradise. The one star is merely for the likely overworked and underpaid CGI artists who managed to cram as much of their magic in there before deadline to try to salvage this…  
The Longest Yard 2005;6; The stacked cast, decent chuckles and solid soundtrack makes this sporty comedy much more enjoyable than it ought to be. A fun time pass watch. 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10; this was brilliantly done. i’ve always admired how selena is so relatable and real. i really commend selena on being so vulnerable and speaking up about mental health because i know it wasn’t easy. i’ll always love you selena 
The Whale 2022;10; It's the fucking Brenaissance baby, let's fucking go. 
Orphan: First Kill 2022;8; when your circle small but all y'all crazy 
Hocus Pocus 1993;8; Sarah Jessica Parker in this movie, please respond to my calls 
Atonement 2007;10; 13 years old saoirse ronan was robbed of that oscar for her performance as THE DEVIL 
Little Miss Sunshine 2006;10; I can't believe this movie simultaneously caused and cured my depression! 
Monster House 2006;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  A metaphor about a man trapped in an abusive relationship for 45 years until some kids help free him by killing his wife.  
Nope 2022;10; It’s called “Nope” because that’s the answer to the question “would any sane person actually want a picture of themselves looking down into a well?” 
But I'm a Cheerleader 1999;10; who WOULDN'T go to a bar for julie delphy?? 
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920;8; omg i can’t believe timothée chalamet did all of that 
Casino 1995;10; my favorite scorsese. all this luxury and operatic grandeur surrounding the petty desires of the human heart. a perfectionist buys his way into love, a thief scams her own life, a thug plays at being a cowboy. in the end, all of them are expendable to the system, mere outlets for the expression of the profit motive. no matter if you're a winner or a loser, you're still a guest out here. don't mistake it for home. "it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again." 
The Watcher 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  you’re telling me i binged 7 episodes just for them to tell me this case is unsolved  
Barbarian 2022;8; If you're a horror head, RUN don't walk to this one.Update - lol still so jazzed about this one, such a fun movie theater experience. Restores my faith in humanity. 
Blonde 2022;4; I’d always thought that Marilyn Monroe biopics would be so much better if they cruelly devoted several different scenes to her doomed CGI fetuses. starting to think I might have been wrong. 
X 2022;10; make cinema horny again 
Knives Out 2019;10; a really great who donut film 
Love Actually 2003;8;  “Where the fuck is my fucking coat???”Here we have a romance, a cliche romance movie, but now that we are getting closer to Christmas, this one is a good choice.It’s actually a good movie, it’s about some love stories, where we see how hard sometimes becomes to deal with a true love.It’s an original movie but at the same time a cliche one, the kind of relationships which are depicted here are already seen many many times,…  
Trolls 2016;2; ......jesus christ 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; poderia ser menor e não gosto disso de saber quem é o assassino desde o início do filme, não que o filme diga quem é o assassino, mas qualquer pessoa - acredito eu - que assistir os primeiros 30 minutos já sabe de quem se trata, mas apesar disso o cast é ótimo, Jessica Chastain não ganhou o oscar de melhor atriz ano passado atoa, tem um bom ritmo e é um filme bem agradável de se ver? acompanhar o rumo da história foi algo bastante interessante e recompensador, enfim foi uma boa surpresa. 
Skinny Tiger, Fatty Dragon 1990;8;  Skinny Tiger, Fatty Dragon was well on its way to receive a 4 star rating from me but it started to run out of steam halfway into the movie only for it to pick up the pace again near the end. It's a real shame because this is otherwise a very entertaining buddy cop flick. It has many great comedic moments and plenty of badass action sequences. Sammo Hung (🙌🏻) and Karl Maka have great chemistry together. Sure, they might…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  ***SPOILERS***Excluding No Way Home, Phase 4 has been dookie water since the inception of those awful disney plus shows. For 2 years the only final thoughts I’ve heard about a phase 4 movie or tv show is…“it didn’t have a lot of stakes but it was kinda fun”or“it’s not for me but i can see why someone would enjoy it”Wakanda Forever actually feels like there was effort put into it. Everything is upgraded compared to…  
See How They Run 2022;8;  This a comfy classic Whodunnit, that perfectly delivered on everything that I expected.It was great seeing both Saoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell after some time. They were so much fun and had an electric chemistry on screen. Watching these two solve mystery made even some dull scenes interesting. Sam was this miserable drunk who is just not interested in anything and his character pairing with this smart, naive, bubbly and friendly character which Ronan played was a brilliant choice.…  
Jurassic World Dominion 2022;4;  The Jurassic World films, for me, have never even come close to the greatness that was Spielberg's original dino-masterpiece, Jurassic Park. So in that sense this was always going to be an uphill battle for my enjoyment. That being said, this was just as lifeless and unimaginative as I feared it would be. Bloated with too many subplots and CGI action sequences, completely devoid of any emotional nuance, and derivative of the very foundation on which it builds it's predictable…  
To Leslie 2022;10; Andrea Riseborough knocks it out of the park in yet another superb, tour-de-force and Oscar calibre performance, she is quite simply, REMARKABLE. Performance of the year, in my book. People are sleeping on her and it makes me so damn mad. This is exactly the kind of role and performance people win Oscar’s for and the fact that it’s such a little seen and talked about movie is frustrating.Honestly, right now after having just finished it I’m finding hard to know what to say about it besides ANDREA RISEBOROUGH ANDREA RISEBOROUGH ANDREA RISEBOROUGH. Virtuoso, masterful, raw and transcendent. WOW!! 
Barbarian Queen 1985;4;  ENGLISH belowAls ich gestern nach etwas suchte, das ich mir im Fitnessstudio am Laufband ansehen wollte, fiel mir dieser Film hier auf Prime ins Auge, der in der Kategorie "Fantasy" aufgeführt war. Ihr fragt, warum ich diesen Film ausgewählt habe? Nun, schaut euch das Filmplakat an. Es war einerseits die interessante Farbkomposition des Plakats und andererseits der mutige, feministische Ansatz, der jeder Feministin die Eierstöcke streichelt, der mich sofort in seinen Bann zog. Der Film war übrigens auf Prime…  
Possum 2018;8;  I've finally seen one of the films that I've been meaning to watch since I joined this site. A film with such a cryptic poster that I had no idea what to anticipate. Was it fully experimental? Was it animated or live action? I was fully entranced from the minute I saw it.And speaking of a film that aims to alienate nearly its entire audience. The picture has few spoken lines and several long stretches where seemingly nothing is…  
Roadgames 1981;6;  The poster for this movie has been one of those I've seen constantly here on Letterboxd, so I couldn't help but be curious and finally see this movie knowing very little about it.In many ways, it's a less scary and funnier version of The Hitcher, with Stacy Keach doing a fine job as this truck driver who may or may not have been involved in the murder of a young woman, while simultaneously on a quest to rescue this…  
Black Adam 2022;6; It’s pretty much ordinary with a wafer thin overly familiar storyline and inconsistent comedy, yet ends up a passable superhero entertainer for its solid cast chemistry and surprising dose of Snyder styled bombastic actions. Dwayne Johnson finally gets his part and owns it like a perfect natural fit, adding an interesting dynamic to the DCEU. Apart from him, Aldris Hodge impresses the most. Justice Society portions provide some enjoyable thrills. The mid credits scene was perhaps the most exciting part. It does fall in the instantly forgettable zone when all said n done, nevertheless is a harmless time-pass watch. 
Rope 1948;8;  Rope. 1948. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.A great deal of Hitchcock fans argue that Rope is one of Hitchcock’s lesser films. We disagree. He had just completed Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and and The Paradine Case (1947). These are exceptional films. From 1940 to 1954, Hitchcock was on a roll with exceptional films each year. Then, Rope came along and its eight takes of ten minutes put tremendous pressure on the actors. The screenplay by Hume Cronyn provided a great…  
Funny Thing About Love 2021;6; Came for Jon Heder, stayed for Grandpa Joe and then fell in love with Bryce. When Jon Heder spoke about being unsure if he wanted to marry his wife because she prefers the star wars prequels over the originals, but changed his mind because they both hate the new ones. I felt that. 
Minnesota Clay 1964;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciWithout a co-director to rely on, Corbucci returns to the cowboys and outsiders genre with a picture that, structurally speaking, adheres to many of the conventions of the genre. However, the film succeeds on the strength of it's performances, particularly Cameron Mitchell's as the title character, an enigmatic man with a somewhat complex personality, and Corbucci's directing, which strikes a good balance between adventurous and tension and suspense. Jose…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; I feckin laughed a lot and now I’m really feckin sad. Feck. 
The Autopsy 2022;8; Watching The Autopsy is when this anthology truly arrived for me. A deliberate pace, effective at building nerve-shredding tension, gives way to confronting body horror and stomach-churning self-mutilation. The elegance and gravitas of F. Murray Abraham is an effective contrast to the film’s cinematic savagery, and makes the climatic events all the more sickening. This is a needed dose of the peculiar and grotesque to a series that risked becoming somewhat disposable. 
The Funhouse 1981;8; Despite all the carnie grotesques in this movie, the best part for me was when a random old man points a shotgun at a boy he sees walking along the side of the road for no reason other than laughs. 
The Curse of Bridge Hollow 2022;6;  I saw this way back in May at a test screening with my daughter and thought the story and premise were simple but effective. The cut we saw had really roughed in CGI effects, but we both came away with the feeling that if Netflix completed the CGI they might actually have a pretty good family halloween movie on their hands. Having watched the film again, I still feel that way. The effects are still pretty rough looking and not at…  
Climax 2018;6; A 90-minute PSA on the dangers of being French. 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; they carried michael myers dead body through the streets of haddonfield like he was queen elizabeth being carried through the uk 
Werewolf by Night 2022;8; not Marvel making something that captures the look, sound, and feel of a 1940s movie better than the Oscar-nominated movie about a 1940s movie, “Mank” 💀 
Pearl 2022;8; A masterclass in forced smiling and fucking scarecrows.(Also obsessed with that final/credit scene) 
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;8; 1️⃣, 2️⃣ freddy's coming for u 😝👊 3️⃣, 4️⃣ better 🗝 ur 🚪 5️⃣, 6️⃣ grab your crucifix 💒🙏 7️⃣, 8️⃣ gonna stay up ☝️ late 😴 9️⃣, 🔟 never 👎 sleep again 🛏👻 
Corpse Bride 2005;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  In an alternate ending, Victoria actually marries Emily and they live happily ever after  
Portrait of a Lady on Fire 2019;10; You ever find yourself staring at a bonfire? Just zoning out and watching the flame change every second, feeling the heat, the energy, the anger, the tension, you get what I’m saying. It’s a beautifully hypnotic thing, and that’s exactly what Portrait of a Lady on Fire is. The only difference being that this brought me to tears in ways a bonfire never could. 
Psycho 1960;10; i watched this with my mother 
Coraline 2009;8; Thank god for stop motion and patient people. 
Halloween 1978;10;  When exposed, he only pauses.It's nothing new to note that the horror in many slashers--especially this one--are women's horrors. Stalking, sexual violence, threats to children, threatening phone calls, these are products of patriarchy that women--whether we like it or not--are saddled with facing. In better societies, reproductive labor is shared, but here, under capitalist patriarchy, women (or even just those classified as women) are coerced into these roles. And so we are subject to men's obsessions, men's brutality, men's…  
The Descent 2005;4; the part where it was dark and i couldn't figure out what was going on... iconic 
Patrick 1978;6; Psychokinetic comatose guy with a kink for spitting seeks certified nurse with experience in handjobs for abusive relationship and subsequent death pact. Must love vegetables. 
Spa Night 2016;6; Sure he’s grappling with his sexuality and all that but you really know this kid is confused when he slips cash into his mom’s purse. 
Elvis 2022;6; Why did this move so fast yet feel 4 hours long 
Ginger Snaps 2000;6; Could one consider this a period piece?? 
Pickman's Model 2022;4; If you make a film about paintings so freaky they make you tear your eyes out, they’d better be damn freaky paintings or you should just not show us the paintings. 
Barbarian 2022;8; Me ten minutes in: "I know exactly where this is going"Me by the end:"Well, I had no idea where that was going"And that's as much as I can say. Go in blind! 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;8;  I'm not the biggest fan of Ruben Östlund's films. Force Majeure and The Square were fine, but also rather bland bourgeois satire. Triangle of Sadness is limited in the same way, but it's probably my favourite of the films of his I have seen. It has a good amount of laughs and a few really great moments.Initially Triangle of Sadness doesn't really move beyond the premise of "rich people are silly". To a large extent that is all the…  
About Time 2013;10; A very effective, funny and emotional Rom Com. It’s not perfect, however, this had a real impact on me and reduced me to tears on more than one occasion. It’s warm, witty, gets a few laughs and most of all has a nice message behind it. 
The Babysitter 2017;2; congratulations to this director for managing to make an 85 minute movie last forever 
Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes 2020;8;  Ihr wollt die Zukunft in zwei Minuten erleben?Zwei Minuten wie zwei Schritte, zwei Händedrucke, zwei 180-Grad-Drehungen?!Eine Kausalität im nicht stattfinden ihrer?

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; I too would go on a murderous rampage and take down an entire drug cartel to save Evan Rachel Wood’s Madonna 
BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   El peor error que se puede cometer al ver Bardo es asumir que a Iñárritu le interesa satisfacer a las masas o al circuito de críticos que tanto le han reclamado por años. No, a el no le interesa jugar a la temporada de premios, al menos no con esta entrega. Y por ende es obvio que se le tache de pretencioso e indulgente, al fin y al cabo, ¿quien se cree este cabron para hacer una película de si mismo…   
The Slave 1962;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn recent years, the story of Spartacus has been retold and popularized in a number of mediums, particularly on film and television, but little attention has been paid to what transpired following his death or to the fact that his legacy continued to carry out heroic acts against the Roman Empire. Corbucci's new peplum is an attempt to address this. Interestingly, this was advertised as an unofficial sequel to…  
Smile 2022;6; Can we have it follows?We have it follows at home.The it follows at home: 
Terrifier 2 2022;10;  Few horror sequels have ever dared to be as audacious and idiosyncratic as this one. Long gone is the minimalism of the first film, supplanted by a visibly larger production budget, an uncommonly expansive runtime, and an elaborate, quasi-mythological survivor’s narrative very purposefully designed to give the notoriously misogynist (even by slasher villain standards) Art the Clown his just deserts. So many of these movies end with the killer coming back for one last scare, and Damien Leone dares to…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I too would let tang wei get away with murder  
Last Night in Soho 2021;4; I’m just like eloise because i too am lonely and spend most of my time thinking about anya taylor joy

Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed 2004;10; i think all other movies should be a little embarrassed 
Lady Bird 2017;10; Two names. Two boyfriends. Two best friends. Two semesters. Two school plays. Two dances. Two parties. Two distinct relationships with her parents. Two potential colleges. Two churches. And a hundred million kajillion tears for the scene at the airport. 
In Bruges 2008;10; The only film where you will witness Madeye Moody and Voldemort sit in a bar and call each other cunts.EDIT IN 2022: this review makes me want to kill myself even more than jk rowling does 
Akira 1988;8; everything escalated and went ramshackle quickly. like, how do we get from just a bunch of motopapis to this? 
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  I rarely watch sequels before originals, and I made an exception for Terrifier 2, which turns out to be the most disturbing thing I've seen in 2022, along with The Sadness. Terrifier 2 is as morbidly stimulating and it's ultimately uneven. Despite an incoherent plot and lacking directorial skills, the sheer dread it exudes every time its sporadic killing spree resumes is undeniable, primarily thanks to the creative, extreme ways murders and abuses are displayed, committed by a menacing killing…  
Rosemary's Baby 1968;10; fuck them kids 
Avatar 2009;6; did we ever decide if it was okay to be you know like into the avatars? asking for a friend. 
Slumber Party Massacre 2021;8;  Well, color me surprised.I came into this remake anticipating a modern adaptation of the "classic" slasher film from the 80s, but instead I got a meta slasher that satirically remarks on misogyny and other facets of the genre. Even though I rolled my eyes at some of the ham-fisted and shoved-in commentary, this picture succeeds where others, most notably Black Christmas (2019), have failed. In fact, I laughed out loud multiple times and felt sympathetic toward the characters throughout,…  
The Terminator 1984;10;  There’s a real sense of propulsive momentum running all throughout The Terminator, serving as a clear indication how much skill James Cameron had virtually out of the gate for crafting highly original and innovative event movies, already able to flesh out a fully believable world onscreen here in a way that would be expanded upon even further in the years to come. Made on a modest budget, the film would probably be considered relatively low-key compared to some of the pioneering…  
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;8; this happened to me once 
The Man Who Laughs 1966;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciCorbucci once again abandons the Wesr to travel back in time of the Borgias, where a disfigured but essentially good-hearted man takes on the prevailing corruption out of vengeance and love.Although I am familiar with the classic black-and-white silent film, I felt as though I was watching a completely different film for the most part. The direction and cinematography in this version are far inferior to those in…  
Project Wolf Hunting 2022;6;  Reactions coming out of Fantastic Fest put this on my radar and had me expecting some bat shit craziness. This didn’t quite live up to that expectation. That may be because this past year has been chalk full of some hyper-violent and hyper-crazy horror films from The Sadness to Terrifier 2. Don’t get me wrong, though. Project Wolf Hunting is absolutely hyper-violent and has some craziness in store. My biggest issue with this film is that I had a hard time…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; They fucked it up so bad 
Shiva Baby 2020;10; uncut gems for hot girls who think considering law school is a personality trait

The Nice Guys 2016;10; - "dad, there are whores here and stuff""don't say and stuff. just say dad there are whores here"- "you took the lord's name in vain""no i didn't, janet. i found it very useful actually"- "how much would you charge to beat up my friend janet?"- "you guys wanna see my dick?""nobody wants to see your dick dude"- "you know who else was just following orders? hitler"why did this movie flop 
American Beauty 1999;10; imagine going over to ricky's house for a dime bag and he's just sitting there watching a video he recorded of a dead cat in a dumpster or something and he senses your presence and says "i watch this every day at exactly 3:41pm. it reminds me that i'm not alone in the world" and then he starts crying and you're just like "ricky... the weed" 
The Rock 1996;8; Dieser Moment... diese Zeitlupen-Sequenz beim Finale, wenn Cage die Bengalos auf den Boden haut, mit grünen Rauch in jeder Hand nach draußen rennt, am südlichen Ende von Alcatraz auf die Knie fällt, die Arme in die Luft streckt, kurz bevor einer der heran jagenden Kampfjets noch eine Rakete zünden kann und nachdem Gregory Sporleder die VX-Kugel zerbissen hat, weshalb Goodspeed sich krampfend das Atropin in die Brust ballern musste... ist Bayhem-Pathos auf seinem Höhepunkt. Und vermutlich eine der besten Sequenzen, die er jemals gemacht hat. 
Waves 2019;10; I literally do not care what anyone says this movie is just too good 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; Turns out evil didn’t die that night after all. I admired the ideas, tone & surprise directions HALLOWEEN ENDS took but I can’t say I loved it. After two films of buildup it’s strange to have Michael Myers eventually feel like an afterthought in favor of a new character & story set four years later. By the end of it all I didn’t feel anything. I’m very mixed on this but I think I liked it the most of the David Gordon Green directed films because it tried to at least be something different. 
Halloween Ends 2022;6; they did halloween 6 and jason goes to hell and friday the 13th 5 and It and, like, the pit, and they had the car from texas chainsaw next generation and i thought it was pretty good and fun to watch 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; Saw it at the first IMAX showing in my area.Yes, my rating as someone who gave both Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills a full five stars is correct.One of the most disappointing and underwhelming movie watches of my life so far. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  sort of staggering how half-baked this is. you get the impression no one watched it all the way through before sending it off to theaters. it's full of Images and Visual Ideas (which, in fairness, is more than you can say for a lot of new releases) but none of them really add up to anything. a movie like this needs to either have way less plot and coast on the unsettling vibes, or way more plot so it's actually…

Rope Unleashed 2001;8; Rope Unleashed. 2001. Laurent Bouzereau. Insightful documentary and documentary about the queer film Rope written, directed, & produced in puritanical America in the 1940’s. This was a victory for LGBTQ CINEMA. Informative and brilliant to get a behind the scenes biography on the writing of the treatment and screenplay. Arthur Laurents wrote a queer screenplay and the treatment was developed by Hume Cronyn. The Legion of Decency dictated rules of the film. Quite an enlightening story regarding the closeted life of the 1940’s. Viewed on YouTube. 
Perfect Blue 1997;10;  To put it plainly, one of the greatest movies ever made. If you for some reason have never seen this I encourage you to please seek it out.This is almost prophetic with how ahead of it's time the story was. It's told flawlessly. Even if you fail to understand what actually happened during the first watch, or even subsequent watches, it still works and the themes come across regardless.This is my fifth time watching it but I still…

Halloween II 1981;6;  This is a 6/10 for me, could go down to a 5, but it’s not like a lot of other movies where it’s all just mid, but it goes something like this:Beginning: incredible. It’s a perfect continuation of the first one, and if it was just this, I’d also give this a really high ratingMiddle: really, really bad. It feels tedious, boring, the kills don’t feel all that special and it’s missing the horror of the first one…  
The Grand Budapest Hotel 2014;10; I don't think I've laughed this much at character names 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a very busy film without, thankfully, being a very messy film. They manage to stuff the movie to the (ahem) gills with character and plot without the whole merry-go-round flinging everyone off in a fit of centripetal fury.The film opens with the bad news of Chadwick Boseman's passing which is written into the script in an honorable and respectful way. The Black Panther is gone and Wakanda's secret is known to a very greedy…

Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank 2022;8;  Yes, this is pretty much Blazing Saddles with cats and dogs set in a samurai movie rather than a Western. Yes, the animation looks kinda weird, particularly the way how the characters move. Yes, the humor is plagued with dumb references to pop culture, cat and dog puns and movies. Yes, I am also confused on why they had Gangnam Style on a 2022 movie. Yes, everyone seems to be working on autopilot and most of these actor's voices doesn't…

The Munsters 2022;2;  So stelle ich mir das ungefähr vor, wenn einer dieser Boston Dynamics Roboter sein erstes StandUp Comedy-Special schreiben würde.

She knew it was perfect and everyone would remember it. I think the killing/stabbing was symbolic. Nina thought she was battling another dancer when instead she was battling herself. When the other dancer transforms into Nina and she stabs herself, it’s her killing the white swan aka the innocence that prevented her from fully becoming the black swan. That’s why her injury doesn’t reappear until she’s the white swan for the final act.…

"I was once full, but what was inside me is outside now,” A former psychology student obsessed with mesmerism, turned amnesiac gets a series of totally normal and sane people to commit murder simply by confounding them by not answering their questions, talking in circles, smoking a cigarette and asking them "who are you? Tell me about yourself." If this was just a movie about serial murder via hypnotism it wouldn't be one of my all time favorites, but Kurosawa…

Apocalypse Now 1979;10;  B E A UTIFUL 👏👏Right so I see this as a lot of people favourite movie of all time and best war movie of all time and it was incredible however it just wasn’t “THE BEST” for me sadly.

The Young Girls of Rochefort 1967;10; Rochefort on the big screen in Paris…… could not be more perfect 
The Good Nurse 2022;6; strong performances from both eddie redmayne and jessica chastain, solid acts that could've been better but still feels like something is missing... a movie that is actually about the killer.this in its grand majority is in his co-worker's vision, always coming back to amy's heart problems but never narrating the kiliings that should be the main focus in the movie. as well as we only got to see his corrupted mind in the last tweenty minutes of it and yet it felt rushed and unfinished. ok but not great!

Burnt Offerings 1976;8;  62nd Review for The Collab Weekly Movie WatchThis is precisely what the doctor prescribed, "a very silly haunted mansion movie."In fact, the movie starts off rather seriously, with the stated goal of scaring the viewers.

It's rich in realism with stunning visuals, and one of the best final shots I have seen in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and I'm looking forward to diving into Truffaut's filmography. 
Hangover Square 1945;10;  A man torn between obsessions is ultimately consumed by them in John Brahm’s “Hangover Square.”The director’s immediate follow-on to his successful Jack the Ripper-inspired “The Lodger,” “Hangover Square” depicts a turn of the century English composer, who, in the midst of writing a dark symphony, also finds himself suffering from intermittent blackouts, perhaps, ones of violent ends. “Lodger” and “Hangover” both feature actor Laird Cregar, a looming figure of a gentleman, who attempted to trim down for his latter role…

Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;10;  "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" to many is the embodied spirit of Halloween, the day. It is specifically conceived concoction of a metaphoric "witches brew" that plays on the overall themeology of season. These themes range from energetic efforts entailing the etymological origins of Samhain, the commercialist holiday of current Halloween, body snatching invaders from another world, and the desolate lost town motif all served up on platter as spooky treat to watch within tradition-based form. As such, this…

Pickman's Model 2022;6; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities-Episode 5Sadly the weakest episode of the anthology so far. Like others, it shines in its aesthetic and does a great job invoking that Lovecraftian atmosphere, but its plodding plot makes it a drag to get through. For some of these, it feels like the directors forgot they only have an hour- a lot of exposition but with minimal payoff.

The School for Good and Evil 2022;6; It is very fun and enjoyable. I don’t understand most of the logic and I’m still stuck on whatever the hell happened to one character but it was entertaining. Didn’t need to be that fucking long at ALL though that was incredibly unneeded 
Terrifier 2 2022;4; the concept of pouring endless time, energy and dollars (from indiegogo no less) into some of the most creative kills/gore effects of the past few years only to shoot them like a mila kunis jim bean ad…seriously i haven’t seen this much shot reverse shot since the jodi arias trial

Pickman's Model 2022;4; Between work and the general obstacles of daily life I haven’t been able to get to the cinema as often as I’d like to recently, so I appreciate having something semi-cinematic to enjoy in the evening. Despite this appreciation, I found Pickman’s Model to be the least compelling entry into the anthology up to this point. Well crafted practical effects can’t salvage this piece from a sluggish pace, lackadaisical direction and an indistinct aesthetic. At least Crispin Glover seemed to be enjoying himself. 
Devotion 2022;8;  Devotion is a crowd pleasing inspirational drama that depicts the true story of Korean war heros Jesse Brown (Jonathan Majors), the first aviator of color to complete the Navy’s basic training program, and his wingman, Tim Hudner (Glenn Powell). It’s pretty standard fare as far as inspirational true stories go, but does have some beautiful aerial sequences that look fantastic on the big screen. The element that really stands out here is the friendship between Brown and Hudner. Powell and Majors have chemistry for days and it truly carries…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  The first Black Panther is one of the very few of this franchise that I still maintain a fondness for, Coogler being one of few to inject these with a sense of actual pathos and internal conflict under the still often shoddily produced action spectacle. Thankfully, for quite a lot of this, it’s very good! For something having to work through such specifically difficult and challenging circumstances the fact that it simply functions would’ve been a minor miracle but the…

Out of the Past 1947;10; Watching Out of the Past is like watching a great jazz band, except the musicians aren’t playing instruments, they’re smoking cigarettes. Mitchum plays the insouciant, fatalistic, smart-ass cigarette. Kirk Douglas plays the unflappable villain with a winning smile cigarette. Jane Greer plays the you’re gonna be putty in my hands before I’ve smoked half this cigarette cigarette. Director Jacques Tourneur is a master of building character and sustaining mood, and his work here with cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca is magical!

Women Talking 2022;10;  Sisterhood endures past liberation. It’s going to be impossible to enter into this review and not include some very objective comments in first person. “Women Talking” made me cry more than any film of 2022.

Still, since the crux of “Women Talking” balances…  
Orphan: First Kill 2022;6;  To be honest, the film's subtitle is a little deceptive, isn't it? It claims to be the first kill, however according to the opening, Esther had already killed a few people, thus technically this is not the first kill.That aside, this was an engaging picture with some unexpected twists and turns that explains the motivations of Esther in the original film, particularly her dislikes for certain family members. Furthermore, while it doesn't always manage to fool me, and Isabelle…  
TÁR 2022;4;  Calling it a reactionary, classist, racist and homophobic cancel culture parable is just about the most surface-level reading one could take away from this - and let me be as clear as I possibly can, I think TÁR is precisely zero of these things and would say it’s beyond ridiculous to suggest it is - but I do think that surface level is undeniably there, and I struggle to think of any reason other than Todd Field wanting a convenient…  
Nope 2022;10; Jordan Peele puts his whole bussy in his movies and i love him for that 
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;10;  It’s hard to account for recency bias in saying something this definite, and surely someone will want to start a useless argument or hold resentment against the movie because they disagree, but I think this is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. It’s been a while since I felt that way with something new. But my expectations were high going in and I still thought so 30 minutes in. Then an hour in. Then 2 hours in.…  
The Lost Boys 1987;8; Corey Feldman talking in a deep adult voice for the whole movie is such a choice 
Howl from Beyond the Fog 2019;8;  A Walk Amongst Monsters #61“You don’t need eyes to see”Just… wow. What an impressive short this turned out to be.This might be the calmest Kaiju film out there. Instead of having intense action or frantic scenes of destruction, this is much more atmospheric and fantastical. There’s a reflective somberness throughout the whole thing, with even the scenes of destruction being accompanied by sad, melodic music. It’s beautiful and I can’t imagine this being an accomplishment without that…  
Graveyard Rats 2022;8; I fun little flick that keeps it short and sweet. A claustrophobic chiller that’s may just give you the creepy crawlies. Fun time for what it is. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. David Hewlett and David Straithairn in Nightmare Alley2. David Straithairn and Kevin Bacon in The River Wild 
La Llorona 2019;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberAn intriguing reimagining of the legendary vengeful spirit, who is turned from a villain into an anti-hero by facing off against evil individuals whose hands are stained with the blood of thousands upon thousands of victims rather than the sad innocents she murdered in the Conjuring universe. With this in mind, the story features a political connotation whose insightful remark provokes deep consideration.All the actors do a fine job, but the…  
Black Adam 2022;8;  No hay nada mejor que ver un producto de cualquier tipo en donde se note que está hecho para los fans. Desde el inicio, mis expectativas con Black Adam siempre fueron altas, pero moderadas. Sabía lo que quería ver en esta película, una gran historia de origen con personajes del universo DC haciendo su debut en el DCEU, ver escenas épicas y llenas de acción como si estuviera leyendo un cómic, y eso fue lo que obtuve, en ningún me…  
The Watcher 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Loved episode 1-5 it was intriguing, mysterious and haunting (to some lvl)Episode 6 with the unveiling of the “who did what and why” just gets to be very messy and confusing with so many fingers being pointed but no actual explanation, and you’re like “so you’re really gonna leave me hanging?” Honestly wish they would’ve been actually bold and killed someone or made it more life threatening for the characters I never felt like anyone was in actual danger,…   
Halloween Ends 2022;4; What is this AJAKAKAJDNDBRBWMDIRBEBDHEBVSHEGEBDBEBEDB 
Luckiest Girl Alive 2022;6;  I think this probably tried to juggle more than it could handle in terms of really heavy themes. I agree with the few reviews that say this would have worked better as a TV show. It also definitely falls for the in appearance feminist trap of showing prolonged takes of rape scenes, for which I took the rating down a notch because in 2022 we should be clear on the fact that there is absolutely no need to film rape…  
Argentina, 1985 2022;10; que revienten los anti patria y los anti cine nacional ni olvido ni perdón a todos los que participaron en ese momento y tampoco a los hijos de re mil puta que todavía siguen acá propagando el mismo discurso a los negacionistas ni un vaso de agua 
Sinister 2012;8; nothing warms my heart more than seeing families hang together 
Interstellar 2014;10; I'm pretty sure no one will EVER come close to being as talented as Hans Zimmer is, also I would kill 10 people just to see this in theaters. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; best thing marvel has released since wandavision idk every woman in this film is my mother 👩‍👦 
Causeway 2022;8; I hope J-Law and Brian Tyree Henry became friends after this. Their chemistry together really holds and grounds the film all together. What a treat to see Jennifer leading films again 
Crimes of the Future 2022;10;  Long live the mutilated flesh!I was actually watching the latest season of Slasher when David Cronenberg popped up on the screen and reminded me that I’ve been meaning to see this. Isn’t it just so surreal that we live in a world where we have so many movie/tv options to choose from that we forget what we want to see?! I love it, but damn if it doesn’t get overwhelming sometimes. It also doesn’t help that I make lists…  
Trick 'r Treat 2007;10; sam the pumpkin child could and would tear michael myers limb from limb

The Devil Wears Prada 2006;6; this is just the fashion version of whiplash 
Donnie Darko 2001;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  that scene where donnie tells ms. farmer to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into her anus is why Jake Gyllenhaal is the greatest actor of all time.

Yonggary 1999;6;  A Walk Amongst Monsters #59“Compared to this guy, Godzilla is a pussy!”Did…. Did Godzilla: Final Wars rip this off?Here me out. In this film aliens use their spacecraft to beam down Yongary into a city to destroy it so that they can conquer earth. Which the aliens from Final Wars also do. The beam effect is also eerily similar in both films. Am I losing my mind?I’ll contemplate it later. Anyhoo this (ironically) is a ripoff…  
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;10; A nightmare on the streets AND a nightmare in the sheets 
Lilo & Stitch 2002;10; if you look like Nani, DM me 
The Green Knight 2021;8; An ambitiously strange and majestically beautiful dreamlike interpretation of the Arthurian legend that almost mocks the futility of the hero's journey and shows a ridiculously toxic lust for honor. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  “If I sit here and think about my brother too long, it won’t be the clothes that I burn but the world and everyone in it.”Fuck man. This is one of the most genuine and profound films in the entire MCU. I cried twice in the theater, Shuri easily has the best character arc in Phase 4. This movie is filled with some of the best acting, writing, and directing in the entire MCU. Unlike other movies in Phase…  
RRR 2022;10; the best part of watching this movie with people who have never seen it is getting to the fight at the palace, watching everyone thinking it's almost over, and then hitting intermission and saying "guys...you ain't seen nothing yet" 
The Bodyguard 1992;10; So incredible to finally experience this classic on the big screen for the 30th anniversary. I was blown away by how cinematic it felt. The voice of Whitney coming through the loud speakers was like nothing else. 
Terrifier 2 2022;10;  Spooky Season Ranked (2022)Look, I've been looking forward to this ever since it was announced. I wanted more Art the Clown and more gore. And I would have been happy if that's all Damien Leone had delivered. But this shit right here... exceeded my expectations by goddamn miles. Leone knocked it so far out of the park that it's now in orbit. Oh, am I being hyperbolic in a review again? Who the fuck knows. What I do know…  
Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 2022;8; “i love lyle lyle crocodile cause i like to sing and i like crocodiles that sing, or talk. and i’m eating ice cream. and i just got off school and i walked home from school by myself”they don’t need to know that“yes they do, cause i’m a big girl” 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Cutting off your finger to spite your handUs Gleeson heads have been waiting so long for that Oscar nomination and we’re gonna finally get it (🙏). Nothing short of a masterpiece imo. McDonaugh does it again 
Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time 2021;8; the one single certainty I have in my entire life is that I will never understand the plot of an Evangelion movie 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Halloween Ends. 2022. Directed by David Gordon Green.Halloween Ends (2022) is a sad day for the Halloween franchise’s own demise. David Gordon Green et al. screenplay was incongruent with the original premise and left the entire fan base with a hollow film. Despite the negative reviews, we viewed Halloween Ends with an objective mind. However, when a film looks like a Hallmark horror film that is a bad sign. John Carpenter’s original Halloween (1978) confronted suburban complacency and the…  
Smile 2022;8; and men will still be like "you should smile more" 🙄 
Triangle of Sadness 2022;6;  It’s been a long two years since audiences ran away from the American remake of “Force Majeure” like it was a killer avalanche cascading towards their families, so perhaps Ruben Östlund — the rascally Swedish filmmaker whose other features include “Play” and 2017’s Cannes-winning, take-no-prisoners caricature of the art world, “The Square” — has just forgotten that other people are perfectly capable of making toothless, watered-down versions of Ruben Östlund movies. He may have dug that particular hole, but he’s…  
Jennifer's Body 2009;10; of course it’s the indie band 
American Psycho 2000;8; he was just trying to see if they're cakes 
The Purge 2013;4; these rich families are so weird if i was a privileged american during the purge i would quite simply go on holiday? 
Twilight 2008;10; “you don’t even say hi to me”“hi”A MASTERPIECE 
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;10; “what the hell are dreams anyway?”i really don’t care how corny this actually is, the concept alone terrifies me. so much so that i’ve actively feared watching it for years. it wasn’t all that scary to actually watch now, but instead thankfully rode the perfect line between spooky and campy. i unapologetically loved this, and the startling dream concepts within the movie are so original and horrific and sometimes hilarious that i was completely drawn in from start to finish. and a highlight of the screening: the whole audience broke into hysterical laughter when nancy pulled the coffee maker out from under her bed 
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 2002;8; i still cant believe this was directed by the guy who colonised america 
The Grand Budapest Hotel 2014;8; is it possible to frame an entire feature film and hang it on your wall? have we discovered how to do this? asking for a friend.

Halloween Kills 2021;4; michael may be a murderer but at least he wears his mask over his nose 
O Brother, Where Art Thou? 2000;10;  “Pete, it’s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.”Their filmmaking may have reached greater heights as it were, but it's possible the Coens never did anything as simply pleasurable - easy on the eyes and the ears and the mind all at the same time - as this. This is Homer's Odyssey wrapped inside a whimsical tall tale inside the earthly idiom of a folk song, it is something so very singular in…  
Hellraiser 2022;6; People who are into BDSM would really enjoy this movie 
Ringo and His Golden Pistol 1966;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciFollowing up such an iconic and career-defining film can be a daunting task. Only a select few are able to pull off such a feat, and Corbucci has not, at least not with this film.Not that the film is bad in and of itself. There is a lot of action, with bullets flying everywhere and hitting everything in their path, and the ending is reminiscent of Rio Bravo.…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; Growing up listening to and watching Weird Al, a little bit of me wanted to know more about the real man behind the accordion (where’s BEHIND THE MUSIC when you need it?) but the fact he and a very talented team of filmmakers and an army of cameos parodied the biopic itself (with a fantastic BOOGIE NIGHTS and DOORS homage if any kids would get that) feels perfectly apt. Radcliffe is great but his roommates/band members steal the movie anytime they’re on-screen. I want a spin off series with those guys solving mysteries. 
Baby Driver 2017;10; Well, it's perfect driving with your favorite music 
Causeway 2022;8;  So nice. Very quiet, very gentle, superb performances. I think a lot of people would maybe see it as boring because it is a film not trying to be overly entertaining or big and grand, it’s in its lane and doing what it does really well. Margot Robbie gives a standout lead performance, she says and does so much without doing very much at all, it’s all written straight across her face, in the eyes, in the expression, truly masterful…  
It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown 1966;10; Yeah Top Gun Maverick is cool and all but it ain’t no Red Baron dog fight where Snoopy files a freakin dog house. 
Barbarian 2022;6;  Not being on the same page with the mass opinion fucking sucks doesn’t it?I’m not saying this film is a terrible film by any means. There’s a lot to enjoy and admire about this here. The directing, score, and visual style is pretty strong, the acting is very solid, and I appreciate how crazy and bonkers it went with how it approached the horror elements towards the end and such (l can’t believe Disney gave Fox the approval to…  
Dead Poets Society 1989;8; if i were neal i’d simply tell my father to fuck off and marry ethan hawke like god intended 
Suspiria 1977;8; dario argento wants to fuck the primary colors and u know what, i think we should let him

Whiplash 2014;10; gotta add jazz to my list of irrational fears 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; I cried a lot 
Kiss Me Deadly 1955;10; Packs a wallop each time. It starts off as myth, born out of darkness, reveals itself as L.A. noir, and then literally explodes back into myth again. 
The Adjustment Bureau 2011;8;  The Adjustment Bureau is a sci-fi(?) romance thriller that’s also full of religious themes. Here, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt tries to rewrite their fate against an omnipresent group of supernaturals. First off, great concept! I adore these types of moral dilemmas characters have to face, and despite the plot almost touching the concepts of a supreme God and Angels, it was never off putting or uncomfortable to watch. Even non-theological fans could ride The Adjustment Bureau’s underlying message of…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2; Incompetent and painful in nearly every way imaginable (yet it isn't the worst one of these things), to say Chadwick Boseman is rolling in his grave right now would be an understatement 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  This was such an amazing tribute to Chadwick, so many heart felt moments. There are a lot of times where the movie is silent and you can really hear the impact Chadwick has made.I love how this movie handles itself. There are so many different layers and emotions on how to deal with grief, beautiful movie. Incredible performances all around! Namor was a great villain, the stakes are so high and a lot of moments very intense which is…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  the minute the marvel logo appeared over silence i was in tear. to even call this a “marvel” film would be a great disservice what ryan coogler has created. this film was made in the process of grief & healing. it was cathartic to watch a film with so much heart and depth something that stands firm & tall on it’s on. letitia lead this film with strength, grace and honor to chadwick. ryan coogler’s directed paired with autumn’s cinematography made this…  
La Chinoise 1967;8; The worst revolution in human historyMade on a shoestring budget, occasionally funny frequently full of ideas. Ahead of it’s time and more relevant to today’s world of angry socialism that offers no alternative solution. 
A Cat in the Brain 1990;8;  A zany and absurd take on the horror genre, Un gatto nel cervello is a fantastically tropetastic schism of purist gore and hilarious creativity. Goopy entrails, slippery eyeballs, hacked bodies, indiscriminate boobs, chainsaw decapitations, steak tartare and buckets full of the red stuff all slosh around inside Lucio Fulci's strained mind and as the visual bondage of it all continues to squeeze, this director's mind steadily transforms to mush.As Fulci wrote, directed and played the lead part of the…  
Ed Wood 1994;10; This is the film that introduced me to Bela Lugosi and fueled my love of trash cinema. 
Seven Psychopaths 2012;10;  I had no idea about the existence of this movie directed by Martin McDonagh before and I don’t know why! It’s a really good one.It’s about a writer who wants to make the script and the story of a movie, thanks to the help of a friend of his, he gets the inspiration to keep going.It has a really great premise, a lot of interesting characters and a mesmerizing story with a good plot. It has a good…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;10; 🎬 Check out my 2022 movie rankings here!🔙 Check out my other Don't Worry Darling (2022) review here!🔜 Check out my My Policeman (2022) review here!The only thing missing from this movie is Elizabeth Olsen and Kathryn HahnI think watching this a second time was absolutely needed because I feel like I missed a lot of details from the first time watching so honestly I’m way more satisfied after the ending of this movie than I was before. 
The Cat Returns 2002;8; Rule #1 Don’t Save a cat from death😂This is thirteenth watch of studio Ghibili Productions and again another great addition.Had some great laughs, beautiful animation and a entertaining story. This wasn’t as impressive as the other studio ghibli movies but still a great watch.👍👍🐈🐈‍⬛🥛🐁😃🎥🎥 
The Menu 2022;8;  Get a pile of napkins ready, because to bite into “The Menu” is to chomp into a greasy, juicy mess of a movie that will likely leave a blood trail of condiments strewn across viewers’ laps. Chances are though, those same aoli-soaked audience members will still be licking their fingers for every last bit of “The Menu’s” flavor. “The Menu,” which unfolds over the span of a diabolically chaotic meal at a prestige restaurant, arrives served from director Mark Mylod.…  
Barbarian 2022;10; whoever thought of this has some severe mummy kinks 
Father of the Bride 2022;6; Basically bumped up a full star for maybe being the only studio comedy I’ve seen in years that doesn’t play out in close ups for 90% of its running time. 
Titane 2021;8; I can’t believe she cheated on her baby caddy with that fire truck slut 
Licorice Pizza 2021;8;  "Do you remember my real name?"Everybody wants to be seen, whether they're 15 or 25, whether they're the Japanese wife of a racist who doesn't speak the language or just another girl growing up in the small town of Intercourse (I've heard all the jokes), but the available avenues of perception exploit us in exchange for recognition, whether it's the Tiny Toes cameraman spanking Alana Kane or that avaricious Hollywood beast Fame gobbling up people like Gary Valentine and…  
Mr. Harrigan's Phone 2022;8; Did they just forget to give this movie an ending?? 
Eyes Wide Shut 1999;10; Idk about you guys but I could see Tom Cruise attending something like this in real life 
Halloween 1978;10;  The thing that sets apart Michael Myers from other slasher villains such as Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kreuger is that Michael Myers doesn't have a motive for his actions, he's just evil. He isn't really a man, he isn't a creature, he just is. He isn't getting revenge on a bunch of parents because they all burned him to death, he isn't killing a bunch of teenagers because some teenagers in the past let him drown, he is just killing…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;8; WENDELL & WILD is another dark & imaginative stop-motion animated film from Henry Selick. Continually pushing the visual boundaries of the art form forward, with magical music & fun voice performances, it’s a shame the well-intentioned but overflowing story loses focus & suffers. 
Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers 1988;8; Loomis is just Michael's hype man at this point 
The Truman Show 1998;10; worried for the guy taking the longest bath of all time 
Whiplash 2014;10; If Whiplash had a dick, I would suck it. 
Suspiria 1977;10; dario argento: *bashes me over the head with a neon light while Goblin is screaming in my ear* me: wow.............thank you so much 
Black Swan 2010;10; honestly? WHERE is the prequel about Winona Ryder's rise and fall as a prima ballerina and her steamy and tempestuous affair with her dance director, Real Man Vincent Cassel? 
Barbarian 2022;10;  ⁠one of the best horrors of the year, easily! I was so unsettled the entire runtime of this film and never once expected where it would go next which makes me so glad I went into this as blind as possible because it made my viewing experience *perfect.* the writing is stellar and so are all of the performances, specifically Georgina Campbell who completely shines and successfully earns her scream queen title! it's also hilarious and doesn't take itself too…

The Canal 2014;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberAn Irish take on the "The Amityville Horror" plot, in which a guy who spends his days at work watching old murder recordings moves into a home where he is tormented by the soul of the killer who lived there.This picture, for the most part, lacks anything unusual or distinctive. It has a lot of the conventions of the genre, but the acting is solid, and the mystery and the way…  
Rosaline 2022;8; Every time there was a scene with Dario, all I could think of was young Rosie in Mamma Mia 2 saying admiringly, "He has a boat!"

Terrifier 2 2022;8; Congratulation to my boy Terrifier for single-handedly dethroning countless Juggalos and politicians as the scariest clown of 2022. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  Score : 9.1/10 ✅The Banshees of Inisherin could be the greatest film to truly convey what it feels like to experience extreme loneliness and, on the other hand, a desperate need for quietude. How can a movie so sad be this funny? That’s probably my biggest surprise here. I wasn’t ready to laugh that much and be moved by a specific scene. It shows that Martin McDonaugh is a very intelligent director that can bring to life anything he…  
The Shortest Day 1963;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciCorbucci takes his comedy work to a new level with a parody of The Longest Day starring the then-popular duo Ciccio Ingrassia and Franco Franchi, whose dynamic is dynamite and frankly, much of what makes the film truly delightful. Their energy and oddball personalities, with Ingrassia as the buffoon who makes humorous faces that are occasionally over the top and obnoxious, and Franchi as the somewhat neurotic straight man.…

Wendell & Wild 2022;6; So true Jordan Peele and Henry Selick, I DO love cute goats and HATE the prison industrial complex! 
Forgotten 2017;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberThe best Park Chan-wook film that he didn't make. A convoluted but ultimately tragic and moving exploration of loss and vengeance, where the forces of evil that torment the characters are not ghosts or monsters, but rather the sins we have committed in the past.Like Barbarian, this is a picture whose plot evolves throughout its running time, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats the entire time. The acting is…  
Pearl 2022;8;  An XXtraordinary performance by Mia Goth.First of all around of applause to the real star, Mia Goth who gave a brilliant performance from start to finish. I love her range of her acting in this movie and you feel just as worried as her parents in this movie for the character Pearl as she is totally creepy and unpredictable I’m ever scene. Overall the directing and cinematography was beautiful and felt very much like a horror version of Wizard…

Entergalactic 2022;6; it looks really nice!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Gonna need to sit on Wakanda Forever for a bit, but it’s undoubtedly the most cinematic film Marvel’s ever produced. Coogler upped his game SIGNIFICANTLY in the visuals & it’s amazing what happens when they give VFX a proper timetable. 3rd act battle is PEAK MCU climaxes.It’s a film that chronicles the mourning process while perhaps being a bit too emotionally manipulative in the backhalf. It mostly works, it’s, thankfully, an authorial decision and not an MCU mandate, but I’m…  
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 1993;10; Please… I need it to be different now. I know I made a promise, but I didn’t see this coming. I didn’t count on being happy. Please, tell me that it’s okay.rest in peace kevin, you were the best. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Angela Bassett Forever. 👑 #315 
Hangover Square 1945;8;  Wow what a unique film noir and a great one to dip my toe into noirvember. It definitely subverts a lot of the conventional narratives with it dabbling mainly in the musical realm but holds it with the femme fatale. I enjoyed the crux of George Bone played amazingly by Laird Cregar dealing with problematic issues of sound but also harmony being his profession and inspiration in life a double edge sword. Sure it plays on some clichés but I…  
Winter Meeting 1948;4; Boring Boring Boring. I’ve often spoken about some of Bette’s best, well here we are with one of her worst. Just so uninteresting and dull, nothing about it worth mentioning in a positive way I feel. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; I think recasting Martin Freeman as T’Challa was controversial, but definitely needed. 
Terrifier 2016;2;  this is a super corny attempt at a #branded horror icon and it seems a lil late in the game to do torture porn?? this movie really sucks imo! then again i don't go for these over the top grim ultra violent mean-spirited man horror movies that are obsessed with how edgy and dark they are but maybe thats bc i havent let rot infest my soul or im not a misogynist who gets horned up on seeing women get…  
V/H/S: Viral 2014;2; I didn't follow the order and watched V/H/S94 before this one and to be honest I didn't think it was bad but not so good either. If only I knew… I just saw a cloak killed and ate people.Cloak: an outdoor overgarment, typically sleeveless, that hangs loosely from the shoulders.A cloak! I'm so done with this franchise. The first one was good, it was new and original but enough is enough, a cloak! And I don't even want to talk about the rest of the film. I'm not sure what to expect from V/H/S99 but anything will be better than this. As long as there's no cloak. 
American Made 2017;8;  After finishing the Mission Impossible marathon with my mother until the arrival of the ostensibly final two installments of the saga, I noticed that this film was available and decided to watch it with her to continue our random and unofficial Tom Cruise run.Anyway, this video is still as entertaining today as it was over five years ago when I originally saw it, albeit I recall it being considerably less hectic. Liman's use of many cameras and formats is…  
Caché 2005;10;  A Resonance of Colonialism & The Gravity Of ThreatSomeone is secretly filming a house and sending the family the tapes accompanied by violent illustrations. To discover where the threat comes the husband recollects his past. Repressions of personal guilt also connect to Frances history of foreign expansion and immigration. Knowing he is watched but not knowing who or why awakens an inner confrontation in the husband symbolic of what modern the national consciousness of the west resists. Much like White…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;2; The in memoriam stuff: beautifully done. The other two hours and 35 mins? Honestly about as bad (and certainly as cruddily lit) as Marvel gets. Full review, written with a heavy heart, here. 
Speak No Evil 2022;8; Couldn’t sleep in the middle of the night. Watched this horrifying thing because I’m bad at decision making. Afterwards had to look up the actors on IMDB to make sure they were alive and doing well and that the movie was “just pretend” then had to cuddle up next to my sleeping wife who is a Leo and would never let this happen to us. 
Vice Squad 1982;8;  "Vice Squad" an early 80's crime venue about a night of sheer, abundant sin and violence leading each respective person involved on a straight ticket to Hell. As most take a look at locational Hell within the conventional sense full of fire and brimstone, this film looks at it within the locational capacity of the dark underworld inner city, with its abounding abundance of "Neon Slime". The brilliantly topical descriptor for the bright lights amongst the seedy surroundings is respectively…  
Causeway 2022;10;  2022 RankedA24 RankedIt’s so unfortunate this probably won’t get the love it deserves for the reason that it’s a very intimate, unshowy drama made by a first-time feature filmmaker being released onto a streaming service, because it’s incredible and certainly one of 2022’s absolute best offerings. Found this to be immensely touching in all its Debra Granik-esque intimacy, a reason being that Lila Neugebauer has so much trust in her actors and never once succumbs to contrivance. There…  
Do Revenge 2022;8; amy dunne would be proud of these girls 
Videodrome 1983;10; watched then went home and smashed my tv with a fucking hammer 
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;8; Dear god I wouldn't last 10 minutes in this universe. Sleeping is literally one of my hobbies 
Donnie Darko 2001;8; somehow it just makes perfect sense that in his debut film, Seth Rogen's very first line is "I like your boobs" 
Coco 2017;8; A story about death, murder, loss, grief, aging, dementia, living skeletons, and deadbeat dads.Y’know, a kids movie. 
Moonlight 2016;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i love how when the third act starts and you think "oh my god... he's so different now" then chiron gets a phone call from kevin and BOOM he's back to that boy from the first act. moonlight invented acting  
Marie Antoinette 2006;10; sofia coppola: we are going to clear up that marie antoinette did not say "let them eat cake"set designer: that's cool and all, but shouldn't we take these converse shoes out of the shotsofia: what is this, a documentary? 
Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed 2004;10; Much better than The Godfather 
The Lost Boys 1987;10; oh to live in a world with as many neon lights as a Joel Schumacher movie 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; eddie and jessica's performances were incredible 
Terrifier 2 2022;10; art is so me when im silly 
The Northman 2022;4;  Mudled, ugly and makes me miss when respectable auteur decided to go nuts with an arty medieval adventure resulted in Boorman's Excalibur. That said, Eggers has a commitment to his grim aesthetic as silly as it can be (or as a friend well put "it is a Manowar album cover that takes itself very seriously") and make something of this scale both highlights how he has very specific unusual taste and how regressive it all is. I like that he…  
The Lair of the White Worm 1988;10; Amanda Donahoe in this movie is one of the baddest of all time. 
The Stranger 2022;8;  The Aussies are the undisputed masters of the grounded exploration of crime, whether it's through uncompromising portrayals of real events like "Nitram" and "Snowtown", or renditions tinged with humor like "Chopper" and "The Magician", their unwillingness to place bias and comfort with their own criminality always creates works of great perceptive understanding that brilliantly confronts situations of a relentlessly disturbing nature. "The Stranger" resembles other Aussie thrillers in the vein of 2008's "The Square" and/or "Animal Kingdom" (both involving my…  
The House of the Devil 2009;4;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now Say whatever you want about the senseless murder and whatnot, but at least that satanist knew not to waste a perfectly good cigarette.Let’s get this out of the way. This thing’s fucking boring. Full stop. It takes to long to set up the plot and once the plot unfolds nothing happens. It takes thirty minutes to even get her into the house that the film’s named after. Then she walk around the house,…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; Jordan Peele for cheap feminism. more in the realms of The Cure for Wellness than Us though, especially in terms of stupidity / cleverness of the whole construction. self empowerment is an old hat in the film world and having some Ben Shapiro like podcasts firing up the whole shenanigans is well just what you expected as first guess five minutes in. this, or aliens, and aliens would have been probably kinda cool. bummer. 
Halloween Ends 2022;2; i KNOW this man’s dick was not good enough for allyson to be acting like a fucking idiot 
Oldboy 2003;10; I don’t quite love Oldboy as much as I did when I was 15 but it still packs a hell of a punch. A frenzied tale of torturous violence and stylistic excess with a hint of macabre poetry. The film is as enrapturing and gut-twisting as it ever was, particularly in its mind-melting climax. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  In a world where biopics take themselves far too seriously, enter Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. Extremely on brand with the classic Weird Al humor, both in its jokes and its self-aware parody of the genre, but even with its barrage of jest, buried beneath the layers of idiocy lies a rubber chicken. Not a heart of gold like you'd expect because that would be something a normal biopic would invoke and Weird is anything but normal. And that's the…  
My Policeman 2022;4; i yawned i snoozed a number of times i dozed i drooled i slumbered i got bored i slept and i had many naps 
Ginger Snaps 2000;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  the apt feminist discourse around Ginger Snaps typically centers around the sisters but the mom, who bakes multiple cakes and offers to burn down the family home with the dad in it in order to protect her daughters, deserves to be a part of the conversation  
Before Midnight 2013;10; “the first film is about what could be, the second is about what should have been, before midnight is about what it is.” — ethan hawke <33 
Scooby-Doo 2002;8; “I’ll never forget the day Shaggy walked on set and announced he had killed God.” 
The Craft 1996;6; clueless on crack 
X 2022;8; Finally, a horror film that will appeal to critics just as much as horny 13 year old sleepovers!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; Got a great 4D experience by crying through much of the beginning, middle, and end 
One-Eyed Jacks 1961;4; Uninspiring story that’s been told a million times. Lazy editing and awkwardly paced. Brando uses this as a platform to over pose and over ponder his hollow character.Brando does have an incredibly handsome and photogenic face but he is not the greatest actor ever, nor of his generation. Some nice photography. 
Lightyear 2022;6; 2022 RankedVery impressive looking animation for the 90’s. 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 2003;10;  1. Of the three Lord of the Rings films, this is the one it's easiest to poke holes in. It's somehow both overlong and maybe a little too short, connective tissue missing here and there. The "there are too many endings!" criticism is wrong, I think, but also not REALLY wrong, because by the time you get to the last 20 minutes, it does feel like it ends six or seven times. It's always been my least favorite of the…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; i just know that in another universe, namor and aquaman are besties 
11.22.63 2016;10;  No disrespect to Jake and Al but I could do the job done quicker and better than these sorry ass dudes.Jokes aside, this is easily one of my favorite limited series. Despite one mimic performance by James Franco, everything is great. Sadie IS very well-written (I never used this word, so u know she's something else) character with a perfect casting. So does Bill, Lee, Marina, Al, and so on... perfect casting indeed. This series hooked me at the…  
Bringing Out the Dead 1999;8;  Chaotic overload. A perfect visual representation of what the life of a paramedic must be like. Much like how Scorsese’s After Hours dealt with someone plummeting into unlucky shenanigans a decade prior, Bringing Out the Dead deals with someone devolving into a nervous breakdown. The film comes at you hard and fast. It’s a very unusual style for Scorsese, so much in fact that it took me a bit to settle in. Once I did I embraced what he and…  
Tommy Guns 2022;10;  Agora vai e entenda seu tempo. Deixa para os mortos, o que é dos mortos.Violenta, cheia de reviravoltas e absurdamente bem filmada crônica sobre a extrema dificuldade de Portugal não superar seu status Imperialista. É surreal como o filme lida com marcas dominantes na linguagem clássica cinematográfica portuguesa - como o prólogo soar pouquíssimo narrativo e em seguida ser uma parada corporal / erótica sobre os soldados - e aos poucos tudo se mescla construído um clímax fora do…  
Barbarian 2022;8; La premisa, engañosamente simplista, no prepara al espectador para el viaje genuinamente perverso que acabará siendo y ese resulta uno de sus atractivos fundamentales. Su guión, hábil, inteligente, sabe explorar uno de los miedos más elementales que cultivamos como individuos: el miedo a lo desconocido.Armándose de una tensión in crescendo y un carácter genuinamente imprevisible mientras explora personajes que tienen más dimensiones emocionales de lo que solemos atestiguar en un film del género, acaba siendo no sólo envolvente y entretenida sino cruda, abrasiva e innegablemente inquietante en todo momento mientras ofrece un salvaje despliegue de brutalidad. 
The Invisible Man 1933;10;  With its groundbreaking special effects and a terrific lead performance from Claude Rains, The Invisible Man is only the second of the Universal Classic Monster movies that I've seen but one that I really enjoyed a lot more than I expected to. What really surprised me about this is just how fun and goofy the whole film is as it really takes the concept of an invisible man and uses it to show off all sorts of gimmicks and bits.…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; what if The Matrix were made by straight, squishy liberals and had more needle drops than something parodying scorsese. what if that was a movie?? would be messed up 
Mandy 2018;10; SPECTACULAR  
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;10; This is one of my favorites cult horror films but I'm taking half a star because Nancy MacGyver is still annoying as hell. 
Dazed and Confused 1993;10; It's been exactly one month since my last Dazed and Confused rewatch and I think that's a new personal record. Can I get some respect for that? 😅 
Aftersun 2022;6; i never found an entry point to emotionally connect with/or get what it was saying (and, i dont want this to read as condescending,) but the cinematography was cute! 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  🚫43%2022 list - Click HEREYouTube video review - Click HEREThe saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode comes to a spine-chilling climax in this final installment of this trilogy.In an odd finale to a trilogy with so much potential, Halloween Ends delivers a mixed bag of fun moments and sloppy writing. There is 20-30 minute period of this experience that had the audience clapping, screaming, and gasping. This final act is one that features more than a few…  
The Lighthouse 2019;10; dinner with papaw tonight...❤️ he made 12 lobsters for all 6 wickies and only one showed. 😢 love him 
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 2003;8; is matthew mcconaughey ugly-hot or is he just ugly? or just hot? ugh an enigma 
The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993;10; oh miss sally poisoning that disgusting man! we stan!!! 
Juno 2007;8; imagine giving birth to michael cera's child 
Dead Poets Society 1989;10; "i was good. i was really good"i'm fucking distraught just kick me please  it would be less painful 
Smile 2022;8; if you told me like 6 months ago that I would end up enjoying this movie I would have probably laughed in your face. something about the premise just seemed silly to me but this was definitely one of my biggest surprises of the year and I love being wrong! Sosie Bacon was honestly fantastic, Kyle Gallner is hottttt and there was some really cool camera work too, I wouldn't be mad if they made a sequel considering how it ended2022 RANKED 
Sssssss 1973;6; A (mostly) sleepy, mad scientist movie about a doctor experimenting on people with dangerous snake venom. Sssssss was released in theaters but it gave me major made-for-TV vibes, probably because they go to great lengths to obscure nudity. Most of the fun stuff (murders, snake bites, a transformation sequence) is loaded in the back.From an animal cruelty perspective this luckily wasn't too bad.Another movie made better by watching it with a fun watch partner. 
Viva Maria! 1965;8;  64th Review for The Collab Weekly Movie WatchWell, talking about... an explosive film.Even though I haven't loved every movie in Malle's oeuvre, I have to give him credit for trying out new genres and, occasionally, mixing many of them into a single film. The film successfully combines elements of humor, musicals, and war movie along with some hints of Western to create an entertaining and, yes, occasionally hilarious movie.Much of the credit for this great level of…  
See How They Run 2022;4; Mediocre TV people who hate movies making smug movies for people who also hate movies. 
The Good Nurse 2022;6; Fun fact of the day kids, this was produced by Darren Aronofsky! I also went in blind and had no idea it was about real life serial killer Charles Cullen and not just some nurse drama. It’s a decent enough watch, nothing grating about it besides some clumsy writing but nothing very novel or electrifying either. It’s carried by the two lead performances from Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne, who play an excellent earnest single mother and creepy weirdo respectively. If you’re into this kind of thing, it’s worth the watch. 
Pearl 2022;8; Toto, I've a feeling we're not in porn anymore. 
Graveyard Rats 2022;6; Graveyard Rats is a slight step up from the first instalment of del Toro's horror anthology. While it's a broadly comical affair, the piece managed to extract more spooky goodness from its brief runtime, and I greatly appreciated the design and execution of the film's monstrous giant rat. It's still nothing exceptionally entertaining, and is certainly not scary, but I am looking forward to seeing what other macabre delights the series has to offer. 
The Day of the Beast 1995;8;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now “Heavy”A priest, a heavy metal rocker, and a tv occultist walk into a bar… can’t think of a punchline but a bunch of batshit carnage ensues!This is definitely more a darkly comedic fight against Satan than an actual horror film. But it’s truly a midnight movie that simply screams cult classic. It’s an absurd race against time before the Antichrist is reborn that can only be stopped by a priest determined to…  
Black Adam 2022;4;  Yawnnn 🥱🥱🥱Can’t believe how boring this movie is so predictable, unfunny And the Cgi was horrible. I’m sorry but this felt so tacky and unoriginal I just couldn’t enjoy any of the scenes, I know Shazam and Black Adam are linked but this felt like a lifeless version of Shazam and just wasn’t exciting at all. The slow motion scenes were aggravating and overused and they kept using the same camera angles. I really really wanted to love black…  
Ready or Not 2019;8; E é exatamente por isso que você jamais deve ver a noiva vestida antes do casamento😘

The Batman 2022;8; The movie version of the "men will literally X instead of going to therapy" meme. 
Re-Animator 1985;8; I’d expect nothing less from a mf named Herbert 
Black Panther 2018;10; Long live the king. Wakanda Forever. 
Black Swan 2010;10; *chuckles nervously* what the fuck? 
Perfect Blue 1997;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  black swan (2010) was found dead in a ditch  
Giorgio Moroder's Metropolis 1984;10;  I was maybe eighteen years old when I saw Giorgio Moroder's Metropolis for the first time — I still have the used VHS tape that I must have picked up in a bargain bin somewhere, and which, over the next several years, I nearly wore out. I knew nothing about the absence of a definitive version of Fritz Lang's film, nor did I know how difficult it was to find before Moroder bought the rights and engineered a restoration. All…  
The Irishman 2019;8;  The Irishman cannot be understood except as a reaction to Martin Scorsese’s previous work. It is a nihilistic story of betrayal and regret, without the thrill of rebellion of Goodfellas or Casino, or the scrappy energy of Mean Streets.Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is an elderly WW2 veteran, living with poor health in a retirement home and sharing his stories with anyone who will listen. The difference is that Sheeran’s stories are tales of murder, his stint working as…  
Causeway 2022;8;  They don’t make ‘em like this anymore.Causeway daringly refuses to overdramatize its depiction of trauma, and Jennifer Lawrence and Bryan Tyree Henry do the same, delivering fully realized and deeply felt performances - and the film is all the better for it. It’s small-scale and patiently paced, but it’s not setting out to change the world - and it’s still supremely stirring nonetheless. Special shoutout to the crisp cinematography and subtle score too, as both work in tandem to…  
Black Adam 2022;8;  Black Adam is one word: HYPE. The Rock brings his flare for the theatrics, passion for EPIC, mythic storytelling echoing the best of Snyder’s DC to put on one HELL of a show. An incredible commentary & deconstruction of heroism as DC forges a TRUE people’s champion. LOVED. IT.The film is definitely a throwback & ya know what? It’s refreshing! I ate it up. Can’t help but feel much of it’s critique of western heroism would’ve packed more of a punch…  
Pearl 2022;10; It anyone was ever fucking crazy enough to wonder what a “Joker meets The Wizard of Oz” movie would look like, look no further 💅 
Rosemary's Baby 1968;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  If I lived in that fucking gorgeous apartment in The Dakota you wouldn't see me complaining about my demon baby  
In the Mood for Love 2000;10;  I remember back when this girl and I were still together, she once asked me when I fell in love with her. I told her it was like a house you pass every day on the way to work. One day, you notice a for sale sign on an empty lot. Another day you drive by and you notice they've laid the foundations. Another day, the walls are up, and another day there's a roof, a garage, and finally a…  
Marebito 2004;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberWhile Ju-onmay be the film that most people associate with Takashi Shimizu, I can confidently attest that it is far from his best work. Indeed, the film's nearly glacial pacing gives the sense that you are plunging into an infinite hole of immense depression, that you, like the protagonist, are seeing your existence fade away, completely absorbed by this existential void. All of this is brilliantly captured through the acting, notably the…  
Studio 666 2022;8;  Something that always makes me giggle in these films about evil music is that the ostensibly unique song is actually quite generic and nothing special.I finally got around to watching this film after hearing so much about it. And while it's obvious that none of the Foo Fighters members can act, and the fact that Taylor got so much of the focus and was on screen with his death fresh in my mind felt odd. Despite all of that,…  
V/H/S/99 2022;8;  I really need to rewatch these to fully compare them, but I feel like this is about on par with the last entry. It’s not scary in the absolute slightest, but it’s very fun and the late 90’s vibes are pretty spot on with the exception of Ozzy’s Dungeon, which was basically a bad acid trip version of Nickelodeon’s Legends of the Hidden Temple and would have been better suited to the ‘94 installment. Come on you guys, we had…  
Speak No Evil 2022;8; This movie is fantastic, but it also completely ruined my night. What a horrible, awful, piece of shit movie this is. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; men will literally cut off five fingers instead of going to couples therapy 
TÁR 2022;10; Drake recently seen in the studio with Lydia Tár, need it or keep it?! 🔥🚨💯 
Causeway 2022;6;  It’s so good to see Jennifer Lawrence play a real person again. Despite the quiet strength she brought to the “Hunger Games” franchise, and the outlandish joy she mined from the likes of “mother!” and “Red Sparrow,” a long run of dreadful “X-Men” sequels and over-cranked David O. Russell fiascos have dulled one of America’s brightest young movie stars to the point where it’s become easy to forget how good she can be.If nothing else, the microscopically small but…  
The Black Phone 2021;8; a movie about the two scariest concepts known to man: getting phone calls and middle aged magicians 
Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers 1989;2; this is mostly just Donald Pleasance screaming at a small child 
Good Will Hunting 1997;8; robin williams guiding white boys is my new favorite cinematic universe 
Good Will Hunting 1997;10; Recommended by Arnav, go check him outI was originally just going to make a joke about Elliot Smith doing the soundtrack, but like, dang, that hit hard. So good, you all should watch it if you haven’t. I need to see more Gus Van Sant movies.🔙 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles🔜 The Vanishing 
The Thing 1982;10; My favourite horror film and probably always will be. 
Black Adam 2022;8; Another regurgitated product of wealthy corporation that does nothing remotely substantial to the film industry, and it's mainly aimed to indulge brainless fun entertainment to the general audience. It's me. I'm that general audience.P.s. To both Atom Smasher and Cyclone, I'm free this weekend hit me up xoxo 
Decision to Leave 2022;10; ”Am I so wicked?"Congrats to everyone who has 'Watch a police melodrama so fraught with sexual tension that you'll crave an after-sex cigarette' on their 2022 bingo card!🪶🪶🪶🪶 1/295th Theater Exp of 2022Best of 2022PS: we won't find out that the Academy snubbed Tang Wei for a few months, but I'm already completely shattered. Wei's performance is on the level with Cate B, y'all. Tang Wei, Park Hae-il, & the immaculate editing are THE 3 factors that elevate the film from 4 -> 4.5. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Peaks emotionally during the opening Marvel Studios logoReviewed on my weekly imitation ‘Siskel & Ebert’ show. Disappointing. 
Lot 36 2022;6;  Really loved some elements.  I always love Tim Blake Nelson. The story setup of a storage locker auction was excellent. Having the lights on a timing dial is a really great story device for a horror flick. The mystery of the previous owner of the locker and the rituals he was involved in was really intriguing. All that being said, the story didn’t quite come together fully. I actually wished this had been a bit longer to allow the story…  
The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993;8; A WONDERFUL SPOOKY PIECE OF ART 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; it’s kind of like freaky friday if you think about it 
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Halloween Ends cements itself as the closing chapter of arguably the most divisive, and successful, horror trilogy ever. An applause goes to Gordon Green and team for really shaking things up with "better late than never" story that is quite compelling. It's clear that this movie is going out of its way to do something different, much like Halloween 3. Think about that. A Halloween movie hasn't dared such a feat in EXACTLY 40 years. Pretty neat actually. But it's…  
As Above, So Below 2014;4; thank god im fat 
The Lost Boys 1987;10; this movie is basically just david getting pissed off because his crush (michael) doesn't like him back 
Causeway 2022;8; Really liked this. A slow burn study on trauma, hope and friendship. Jennifer Lawrence really is great, a more restrained and human performance than we've seen before. Brian Tyree Henry was the same, eager to see him in more projects. This offers conflict, comfort and hope, and whilst the material isn't anything revolutionary, it will certainly stick with me. 
Suspiria 1977;8; A colourful and wild bombastic treat of a movie. One of the best the era and genre has to offer. 
Spree 2020;8; kurt would be huge on letterboxd

Barbarian 2022;8; damn detroit is wild 
V/H/S/99 2022;8;  The latest installment of the V/H/S found footage anthology series takes us to 1999. There's heavy metal zombies, coffin traps, nickelodeon-esque dungeon games, revenge, big bad momma mayhem, face melting, lol moments, blood n guts, sleaze n cheese, hellish wastelands, demons, and a silly stop motion animation wraparound(ish) segment. I enjoyed all of the segments, some more than others as with any anthology. This is my order from fave to least fave...1. To Hell and Back(Joseph & Vanessa Winter)2.…  
RRR 2022;10; people who say this isn't the best movie of all time are totally wrong. come on guys, electrifying, funny, incisive and extremely important, both a sensory and visual spectacle, less than 5 stars would be a crime 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  For the first 20 or so minutes of this, I was all over it from an emotional level. When the film just breathes and focuses on the loss and legacy of Chadwick Boseman's passing, it's a really beautiful piece of cathartic filmmaking. However, it's the stuff surrounding Wakanda Forever where things begin to turn sour. The usual MCU downfalls (weak humour and mostly inconsistent VFX) still apply but the biggest flaw here is no doubt it's pacing. At 161 minutes,…  
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 1993;10;  "I am vengeance, I am the night! I am Batman!"Sad to hear the news about Kevin Conroy. He'll always be my Batman 🦇Kevin Conroy is excellent as Bruce Wayne/ Batman, giving great emotion, subtlety, and understanding to the character just through his voice.There’s a reason why I think he’s was one the greatest voice actor of all time, and one needs only to watch this movie, or 'Batman: The Animated Series' to understand why. It’s just really…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; Better on a rewatch Still 20 minutes too long 
The Last Black Man in San Francisco 2019;10;  What a fucking BEAUTY. Filmmaking at its highest freakin level. EVERY frame. The camera work, cinematography, editing, all that technical shit, hits on full blast. Then we get to the performances, and it only sky rockets from there. The cast and some of the cameos that pop up are all great. Jonathan Majors and Jimmie Fails, sit at the center of all that greatness too. The atmosphere is busting through the screen and with a story this meaningful, it was…  
Falling for Christmas 2022;6; Essentially something you'd see on Lifetime or Hallmark, minus the ad breaks, and it's as formulaic as expected, but I'm just here for Lohan's comeback, and it's harmless fun. It really brought me back to when she showed off her charisma and talents years ago! 
Thelma & Louise 1991;10;  Vi esse filme quando adolescente, quase criança ainda, e achei um ótimo road movie, fascinado com as paisagens, o carro e as "maluquices" das protagonistas. Revi hoje duas décadas depois, em um momento em que as mulheres do mundo inteiro gritam por uma série de direitos, e já vejo o filme agora de outra forma, abordando assuntos tão necessários na atualidade.Absolutamente TUDO nesse filme é maravilhoso: as atuações de ambas, a fotografia, a edição, a trilha sonora, tudo impecável!…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Video Review: youtu.be/UprPiDWUK6UThis is Cinema. The Best screenplay of the year. Easily.This is Martin McDonagh's Best Film.Such a gem of a movie.Colin Farrell gives such a fantastic and heartfelt performance.Shoutout to Jenny the donkey.A beautiful allegorical film about the Irish Civil war.A very relatable and personal film that is filled to the brim with meaning.The mythical/folklore element in this film was such a beautiful and nice surprise. Just incredible.This is the type of film I think works at a poetic level.This is the type of film I wish more directors were even able to make.Kino. 
Graveyard Rats 2022;8; That big rat freaked me the F OUT!!!So episode 2 of Cabinet of Curiosities and this was better than the first one a little more creepy however I just feel like they take their time with the story and rush the ending and aren’t long enough by just maybe 15 more minutes. Guillermo del Toro Monsters are seriously the best thing and carry the series the most but it was still quite enjoyable I’m looking forward to watch the next episode.👍👍🐀🐀🐀🕳🪦🧟‍♂️💰⚱️💍🎥🎥 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; *watching this film and seeing the characters chilling, vibing, and being sad all the time. Me: “that’s so me. Why am I like this?” 
Decision to Leave 2022;8; venting to your voice memos realness… 
Piaffe 2022;2; AFI 2022: film #2a very “not for me” movie. weird and horny and eccentric but doesn’t infuse these elements in cohesively so it falls into incredibly dull territory instead. horse girls make do! 
Son of the Mask 2005;2; There came a point during an ad break where I implored the heavens to just continue playing this Olive Garden Never-Ending Pasta Bowl commercial on repeat for the remaining hour instead of returning me to this godforsaken film. 
Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;8; One great filmmaking strategy is that if you move from one batshit crazy plot point to the next batshit crazy plot point fast enough, the audience does not have time to realize how batshit crazy any one individual plot point is. And, my God, this movie is a masterclass in this technique. 
TÁR 2022;8;  TÁR is a character study of a world famous conductor and the gradual fall from grace due to her abuse of power. This is a cancel culture story at its heart and one that shows the cycle that these powerful people go through on the daily. Cate Blanchett is indeed very commanding in the role. There are scenes with very long takes and a lot of dialogue that she has to sell with absolute conviction. She carries this film from beginning…  
Carrie 1976;8; Do NOT mess with Carrie. Kids can be so cruel. Dated but forever iconic. Great work by Sissy Specek. She really went though it! Loved seeing John Travolta in there too. 
Rosemary's Baby 1968;10; be honest would you let john cassavetes put the son of satan in you?? 
Barbarian 2022;10;  Now I understand why this year is being talked about as a great year for horror - BARBARIAN!!!This might be my favorite film of the year!What a wild, wild ride, like honestly wtf 😂😂😂The hard cut at the halfway point is one of the best I've ever seen. What a bait and switch! What an absolute swing for the fences!I went into this knowing nothing, other than it had received great reviews, and that was definitely…  
Burial Ground 1981;8; The acting was so over the top I'm here for it, they clearly spared no expenses when it comes to the gore part and those zombies looked better than the ones we have nowadays. Now, that kid could have use some therapy if he had to ask "what's wrong I'm your son" but Oedipus would be proud. 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;10;  this is ever after high for theatre girlies you’ve got miss sophia anne beetlejuice controversy caruso and patti just handed in her equity card lupone making an appearance, what a time ! firstly, absolutely tragic to find out that apparently in the books they’re sisters and that’s a likely revelation if this gets any follow ups because sophie and agatha would absolutely slay and serve cunt as a fantasy power couple it’s unfortunate anyway sorry to say that this…  
Braindead 1992;8; There's a slight novelty to watching the work of Peter Jackson before he ventured into the world of Tolkien's Middle-earth. It's not immediately apparent that the man behind this wild gore spectacular would go on to create one of the most accomplished and successful trilogies of all time. What you do see is the mastery over elaborate practical effects and endless stamina that would be necessary to bring the soaring work of fantasy to life. It's also just one hell of a good time if you are inclined to enjoy this sort of thing, which I very much am. 
Friday the 13th 1980;6;  I watched this on Friday the 14th. Is that close enough? Spoiler Alert: The first time I ever saw Scream, the ending to this film was ruined for me the moment Casey Becker got Stu's question wrong and sent him to his guttastic death. Eleven year old me certainly didn't know that one of the most important twists in horror lore would be ruined the moment I put that contraband VHS in. Thank you very much, Kevin Williamson. That said,…  
Rosaline 2022;8;  so happy to finally have two new movies out with Kaitlyn Dever in them this month, I've missed her so much! Kaitlyn was obviously amazing as usual and this was such a fun and enjoyable modern spin on the Romeo and Juliet story that we all know. all of the costumes were so cute and I loved the soundtrack too. I also loved the nod to The Graduate at the end and the Booksmart reunion with Kaitlyn and Nico Hiraga!…  
Tangled 2010;8; Fuck that stupid bitch-ass I See the Light song for making me cry again 
Nope 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   what’s the matter, don’t you want to be on tv?The most quietly haunting scene in this film for me  is jupe recounting the gordy’s home incident to oj and emerald through an snl sketch which exploited the tragedy for laughs. The cut to his younger self watching the incident, traumatised, in contrast to present day him excitedly telling the story showing how his desire for spectacle has corrupted him. He never realises that, just like gordy, he was chewed…

I AM INDUSTRY.I EAT, I SLEEP, I SHAVE, I SHIT,…  
Halloween Ends 2022;2;  'Halloween Resurrections' is no longer alone as the worst movie in the series: 'Halloween Ends' stabs repeatedly any hope of a proper finale (by giving Michael Myers just roughly 8 minutes of actual screentime, by finding a way to not buying Jamie Lee Curtis performance, by selling an horror epic & ending up delivering an hilarious romance without any interest at all) and delivers a bloated, boring and rushed anticlimax that should be forgotten by the very second after the end…  
Katalin Varga 2009;8; When I tell you I gasped. Katalin Varga is a slow burn, emphasis in slow, that doesn't need to be explicit in order to tell its story. We already know what the main premise is and that's basically the entire film. Thorough its runtime nothing we couldn't predict happens but that's not important because it's told in a way that keeps you captivated and wanting to see what will happen next. The only thing I didn't see coming was the ending, which turned out to be so ironic and somehow the perfect way to end the story. 
Pearl 2022;8; She won’t win the Oscar but I hope Mia Goth knows in her heart that she has my vote. 
Bones and All 2022;8; me and the bad bitch i pulled by eating people

Mamma Mia! 2008;8; sometimes a family is a mother and a daughter and a gay dad and two straight dads and two vodka aunts 
The Invisible Man 2020;4;  the epitome of mediocre genre cinema. from screenplay mistakes: all those illogical things concerning the suit, mostly annoying being the typical "we see how the protagonist gets fucked over but the surrounding doesn't" scenes, especially the one where the girl gets allegedly hit by Moss who sits three meters away... jeez, come on, that's imbecile crap and the filmmakers should know better... to simple incapabilities: how are the characters not developed at all? how is a main figure out…  
Batman & Robin 1997;4; This is not Batman. This is just bad, man. 
Pickman's Model 2022;6; Mom: we have Lovecraft at home Lovecraft at home: 
The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) 2017;8; The first most element that stands out in this bittersweet dramedy is the fabulous performances from Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller, proving they still have it in them beyond the mindless comedies. Along with strong support from Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Elizabeth Marvel, they manage to bring out the chaotic family dynamics and generational disconnect in a believably engaging manner. Adding more value are the authentically heavy dialogues with enough wit and quirkiness. Music adds a warmth. Though it does get a bit peculiarly weird n messy at times, the sharp writing with solid characters, performances and comedy make this for a fine viewing. 
The Outside 2022;8; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities- Episode 4A little torn on this one. A not so subtle satire on beauty expectations that works because of the cringe inducing performances, but that’s really the extent of it. Not that it needs to reinvent the wheel, but considering how much I love A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, I just had higher expectations. Some decent body horror though! Almost wish it leaned more into that realm. 
Barbarian 2022;10; By today's standards, making a horror movie like this is really hard. It doesn't quite reach the same level as Malignant, but who cares? it's fucking fun. Curious how it plays with expectations while showing the different levels of evil that seems never ending. There must be more out there, but at least on first impression, one of the best horror this year.Final Score : 95% 🍎 
Barbarian 2022;8;  the term “ruin porn” has always been haunting to me — taking the plight of others, either the people or spaces they inhabit, and rendering them impersonal and focusing only on the degradation of what once was, as Americans, we face and perpetuate this on a daily basis via gentrification, segregation and a blatant disregard for the people and spaces that are different than us yet we forget that we all are after the same thing — this is a…  
House 1977;8; American remakes have gotten out of control. How they got a grumpy doctor with a limp out of this movie, I will never know.

I'm…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; dull in stretches, silly throughout, and the lead actor reminded me of charlie kirk which was super annoying 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;4; why did i watch this? well based off what i’ve seen from the writers, it helps confirm that female incels are a thing. 
One Piece Film Red 2022;6; Maybe the one piece is a decent father 
The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993;8; sally should have just shot dr finkelstein 
Star Trek Into Darkness 2013;8;  Saturday Morning Hot Take:The new Star Trek trilogy is better than the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film that introduced me to the wildly talented Benedict Cumberbatch. All his dialogue is villain speak 101 and delivered with that super intimidating voice. That alone, made me a fan. And even though this is somewhat of a soft reboot of The Wrath of Khan, it doesn’t stop it from being wildly entertaining.The new cast is firmly planted in their roles…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  Wakanda Forever was both a tribute to Chadwick Boseman and declaration that Wakanda is still a force to be wreckoned with. Which is exactly what I expected it to be going in.The returning cast, the new additions, the costume designs, the emotional impact, the action sequences, the ethnic representation, etc...all top notch! The Women of Wakanda continue to shine bright. Even brighter than they did in the first film. Letitia Wright was amazing. She stepped into the lead role…  
Deep Red 1975;10; Why does this have the grooviest murder soundtrack ever ????? 
The Old Man and the Sea 1958;6;  "Everything about him was old except his eyes, and they were the same colour as the sea. Cheerful and undefeated." John Sturges' adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea captures the strange dichotomy between the quiet, cerebral and meditative side of mankind and the physical glory seeking through action side found in the source material. It captures an inherent contradiction that Hemingway never seemed to be able to reconcile. The Old Man (Spencer Tracy) can't simply let…

Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;6;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest Hangover 2022)🎃I'm not sure what I was expecting from this oddball Halloween sequel that has nothing to do with Michael Myers, but I am still astonished this is what they came up with for Season of the Witch.🎵 "Eight more days 'til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Eight more days 'til Halloween, Silver Shamrock. 🎵 ... Yes kids, you too can own one of the big Halloween three. That's right, THREE horrific masks to chose from. They're…  
X 2022;8; I never watched a trailer for this, but was pretty sure the one sheet and stills I saw from Pearl ruined any suspense I was likely to feel. However, in the end, X turned out to be a fun grindhouse affair in the vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the existence of Pearl now actually excites me, since I get to see a continuation of the story so soon after the original.

The Monk of Monza 1963;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciCorbucci continues with his quirky parodies of films and true stories, this time based on The Nun of Monza.Toto plays a widower shoemaker who, unable to provide for his family of twelve (six sets of twins), comes up with the "ingenious" idea of dressing his kids up as monks and begging for food and alms by pretending to be impoverished. Things don't go as planned, though, and our…  
Armageddon Time 2022;2;  "I'm a white Jewish boy but I'm not racist btw. I recognize that white Jewish people have a tenuous proximity to white privilege. My friends at school say bigoted slurs but I didn't say anything because this is actually a defense mechanism and a mode of self-preservation. See my family changed their name to avoid antisemitism so we can assimilate into whiteness just to feel safe, even tho this is at the expense of my foc (friend of color). Maybe…

Noroi: The Curse 2005;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberIt is a crime that this film has not been given more attention, as it is not just the best of the Found Footage movies released in the early 2000s, but also the best of practically all of the movies in this sub-genre.In the same vein as Ringu and other J-Horror films, this film is unsettling thanks to its effective combination of the genre's standard jump scares with a more insidious…  
There Will Be Blood 2007;10;  PTA is fixated on the nuances of these unsightly patriarchs, as if his graphic close-ups into the pores of their skin and the dirt in their fingernails will give us some unique access to their statuesque mystery. but the closer we get to plainview, the more of an enigma of evil he becomes -- "i don't like to explain myself." -- as he's not some ridiculous sociopath, but kind of a nietzschean idiot who couldn't get out of bed in…  
Nine Inch Nails: Woodstock 94 1994;10;  If one thing is certain, it is that the rain and mud incident at Woodstock '94 was a blessing for NIN since it made the whole stage and their presentation look so badass. It was filthy, which complemented the music and the band in general very well.If you're familiar with NIN, it should come as no surprise that their energy on stage, particularly Trent's, is off the charts. Also, for some reason, the band's music sounds so much better…  
Ticket to Paradise 2022;4; My parents will likely love TICKET TO PARADISE…I did not. While the comedic banter & bickering between Julia Roberts & George Clooney mostly works, I did not buy nearly a single moment of this film’s romance, new or rekindled. Bali sure does look beautiful though! 
Castle in the Sky 1986;10; I knew ranking theses movies wouldn't be easy, but holy shit! Second movie and I'm already struggling to choose which one's better.

Notting Hill 1999;8; hugh grant as y/n 
Beast 2022;6;  Enjoyable schlock that could’ve held a lot more suspense and tension than it did. Too bad Spielberg himself wasn’t directing this, but his influence is obvious here. One of the main characters (the oldest daughter) sports a Jurassic Park shirt when they first arrive in Africa. That movie is exactly what this movie is attempting to copy. The director does utilize some really creative camera movements to reveal only when he wants to reveal. It’s a bit like Jaws and…  
Licence to Kill 1989;8; After watching Sextette I needed to see Timothy Dalton in action. I have only seen a handful of James Bond movies so im no expert, but I dig how corny and cheesy they are. Its a shame Austin Powers ruined the fun and now were stuck with super serious lame Bond.007 vs Florida man drug dealers. Underwater fights, car chases, semi truck wheelies, plane and helicopter stunts, bazookas, ninjas, pet iguanas, killer sharks, so many explosions. A dude tries to stab 007 with a swordfish. Bond is gifted a crack lighter. And so many recognizable faces! How could anyone say this is boring lol. 
Meet Me in the Bathroom 2022;6; I liked this… but it’s really funny to juxtapose 9/11 footage with images of Julian Casablancas making sad eyes because he’s too rich and too famous. 
The Murmuring 2022;8; This was the scariest of the bunch. My girl Jen knows what she's doing. 
Barbarian 2022;10;  A bold and brilliant direction, pulling me back into the horror genre like no other recently. Georgina Campbell stars as Tess arrives at the Airbnb late at night and finds out it’s occupied by another occupant Keith (Bill Skarsgard). Unable to go anywhere else, she stays for the night and finds out there’s more to the house than it seems. Everyone in this was excellent. The lead had sharp instincts and a human side when things flip. This was a…

Aber ich kenne die Filme von Dwayne Johnson, also hatte ich eine gewisse Erwartungshaltung an den Film. Und "The Rock" hat mich…  
20th Century Girl 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  It uses all of the stereotypical k drama tropes... miscommunication, love triangles, a drunk Soju scene... however despite being predictable, it manages to make you feel a pang of sadness at the end. I would recommend watching it for the non-romance elements such as the nostalgia for 90's and 2000's, its depiction of the innocence of being teenagers in school, and the passage of time. Its these elements that end up having more of an emotional impact.  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;4; Needed something to dumb myself down after midterms week 
Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance 2002;8; The first film in Park Chan-wook's Vengeance Trilogy is about tragedy and revenge, but instead of being over stylized, he opts for a much grounded approach that’s dark, brutal and ultra violent. Had a few issues with its pacing during the initial hour, but makes up for it quite well in the second with some interesting experimental choices. It does have its shortcomings, but on the whole ends up as a pretty entertaining revenge drama. If you’re a fan of thrillers and Korean violence, give it a shot. 
Lady Chatterley's Lover 2022;8; people from a century ago are so brave, you could die from the common cold and theyre out here sucking and fucking on dirt mounds 
House 1977;10; my death scene is just an allergic reaction to the cat 
The Fabelmans 2022;10; goes above and beyond what you normally expect from a movie about movies. cheesy and over-sentimental at times but i wouldn’t want it any other way. if this is spielberg’s last i cannot think of a better shot to end on. one of the best of the year, easily. and this is all referring to the david lynch scene specifically, rest of the movie is good too 
Watcher 2022;8; If I had a nickel for every time Maika Monroe starred in an indie horror film where she plays a character that gets followed around by sketchy-ass people that may mean her harm…I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice 
Ghostbusters 1984;10; A movie with no emotional core, no character arcs or growth. No one learns anything. It’s not saying anything. It shouldn’t work but somehow it’s perfect. No one has been able to replicate it and they should stop trying. 
Addams Family Values 1993;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  the only thing better than joan cusack killing men and looking fabulous while doing it is christina ricci setting a racist summer camp on fire  
Monster House 2006;6; who the fuck thought the cement scene was appropriate for a children's film 
Barbarian 2022;4; Too cute and schematic to really be effective. Once it reveals what’s hiding in the dark, I became fully disengaged and that’s not counting an interlude that stops the film’s momentum. The film’s surprise is kind of really, really, really tired, design wise. And it’s sense of comedy undercuts any sort of tension. It wasn’t boring but I sort of wish we’d get less cynical exercises like this. 
Barbarian 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I was nowhere close to being prepared for BARBARIAN. Much like the dark, never-ending basement tunnels the characters find themselves trapped in, I had no idea where this was going which only added to the fear & fun. The audience I saw this with was hooked. Lots of screaming at the screen. Go in as blind as possible. It may not hold up as well on repeat viewings afterward but I won’t be forgetting this one any time soon.  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; “If punching a cop is a sin we might as well pack things up and leave” 💀  
Night of the Living Dead 1968;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Dear 1968:We made a film that has the following:-Female protagonist.-Whoops!

In Bruges 2008;6;  In Bruges transita de forma fluida entre a comédia sombria e o drama, graças ao elenco entrosado e com bom timing.O roteiro é bem amarrado e gera com eficiência sentimentos conflitantes, mas infelizmente não envolve e nem cativa, com a história demorando a decolar, a trama se sustenta em piadas rápidas e ácidas o que não funcionou comigo e não me ajudou a ter uma boa experiência ao assistí-lo.Acredito que a proposta do filme seja melhor comprada e…

Star 80 1983;8;  Deceptively dark Hollywood cautionary tale by one of the best (and most under appreciated) filmmakers of the era, Bob Fosse.Eric Roberts is the “star” here, but Hemingway brings a true sadness and and also a sweet girl next door charm that my only makes her presence in scenes like a ticking time bomb waiting to go once her star begins to rise. Love the fractured, nearly doc-style structure to the storytelling and the editing is razor sharp. A truly…

The Hitch-Hiker 1953;8;  This tense and stylish thriller by director Ida Lupino is a real white knuckle rollercoaster ride for its seventy minute runtime. The film is apparently based on a true story and runs with the idea of "it could happen to you" as a couple of everymen are unlucky enough to pick up a maniacal hitch-hiker who is thumbing rides and bumping people off. The film wastes no time in getting down to its plot, and then wastes no time in…

Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;2; I went into this a moderate fan, but came out with a bad taste.Sit down & buckle up for 2hrs of Selena complaining about things she has the power & resources to change.This came across as a list of all the reasons she’s unhappy & for me it didn’t land. I sympathize with her struggles but what is she doing about it? I was ready to hear about what she’s been through, how it’s shaped her, & how she’s getting through, not a pity party. An attempt to come across as relatable & it just was tone deaf. 
Star Trek Into Darkness 2013;8;  Um meine Bewertung und vielmehr den Platz in meinem Ranking von „Star Trek (2009)“ mit Platz Eins und „Star Trek Into Darkness“ auf einem ehrenvollen zweiten Platz zu erklären – stehe ich wohl sehr alleine mit meiner Meinung und Wertung – folgt nun eine Einordnung besagter Filme mit Schwerpunkt „Into Darkness“. Die ersten zwei Filme der neuen Star Trek-Auflage wirken (zu) bombastisch, viel zu sehr „Star Wars“ mit ihren Raumschlachten, großen Schießereien und der allgemeinen Action(lastigkeit) als die klassische Star…  
Aftersun 2022;10; This ripped my heart out. It's the kind of movie that unfurls itself so slowly and carefully that you have no idea what it's about till it's over. 24 hours later and I'm only now catching onto the meaning of that beautiful fading-polaroid shot. The film plays so effectively as memory, that it managed to forever instil itself in ours'. Absolutely, gut-wrenchingly brilliant. 
Prey 2022;8; “does your constant dread over a fictional dogs safety effect your overall enjoyment of the movie?”“it does, and im tired of pretending its not” 
Turning Red 2022;8; miriam talking about boys while wearing that gay ass outfit… give it a few years girlie

The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; exactly what black phillip meant by living deliciously 
Come and See 1985;10; as soon as this film ended i went online and enlisted in the US army. no child will ever suffer like this again on my watch 
Rosemary's Baby 1968;10; my man satan got nothing on the sheer terror of gaslighting and gender roles. 
Valley Girl 1983;6; Frederic Forrest and Colleen Camp, the original cool parents in a teen movie. They walked so Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson in Easy A could run 
The Sound of 007 2022;6; I miss DVD special features. Like, a lot. Streaming has a lot going for it, but making-of docs going from essential staples of home video releases to total afterthoughts really hurts.I don’t think I’ve fully reckoned with how crucial special features were to my interest in movies during college. Sometimes I bought DVDs just to watch the supplements — in a couple cases, I only watched the supplements and never got around to the actual movie. This seems like a void that someone could really exploit. In the meantime there is the occasional film, like this one, that scratches that same itch. 
The Killing of a Sacred Deer 2017;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Me: kill all of these awful people, please just don’t kill the boyYorgos: *only kills the boy*Me: masterpiece  
Clerks III 2022;8;  This felt more like a Clerks retrospective than a true sequel and I have to admit that the first 10-15 minutes felt pretty rough in part because of how old everyone looks.  (With Rosario Dawson, Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck being the exceptions). It effectively starts you off with the feeling that maybe we’ve gone back to the well one too many times. BUT when you get reacquainted with these characters and they fall back into their familiar roles, the film…  
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery 2022;8; just immensely satisfying to see everything fall into place – it’s great! 
Hellbound: Hellraiser II 1988;8;  If I've learnt anything from the Hellraiser marathon that many of my acquaintances are participating in on Letterboxd, it's that, with the exception of this sequel and one of the subsequent ones, the rest of the movies in this franchise are complete rubbish, bottom of the barrel trash. I believe it was Matteo who said in his review, one of the sequels was the bottom of the barrel. So, given as how this sequel was available on Prime, I opted…  
Barbarian 2022;8; Me after Halloween Ends: what the fuck (in the bad way)Me after Barbarian: what the fuck (in the good way) 
Moana 2016;8; My boyfriend likes the singing crab a normal amount 
My Policeman 2022;4; MY POLICEMAN is a painfully average movie with storytelling tropes I’ve seen plenty of times before. All six actors deliver fine enough work to carry the movie (I thought Harry Styles was better here than in Don’t Worry Darling) but I found the ending to be incredibly rushed. 
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On 2021;10;  95"What if everything changes?""It will." It's been almost two months since my father passed away, but I often feel like it happened yesterday. I'll wake up and the grief slams into me like a truck, a mess of emotional rubble, fresh and immediate and painful. I got the call from the doctor early in the morning, before the sun was up. He was already gone but our family rushed over to the hospital as if there was still…  
Halloween 1978;8;  yes it’s a classic and i like it a lot but god it’s so frustrating. she really sat down huh. she really sat down next to him. she really parked that rear in the same room. she really landed that ship in the same vicinity. she really just got up and stood there, without a care in the world. she really just leaned in that doorway looking somber as sally. she really rested her tidy mind for a sweet sweet second…  
Gun Crazy 1950;8;  This should always be viewed after watching Ray’s They Live By Night. Gun Crazy is full of all the pizzazz, self-searching, and genre-defining of the lovers-on-the-run plot, embodied both in the character, as in the hero’s search for a use for his pistol fetish, and in the form of the film, as in Lewis’ queasily tense, stunning single-take drive-by robbery. But it is the Ray film that humanises the scenario, gassing it entirely on the tender romanticism of the couple. The two films are companion…  
Fire Island 2022;10; the yassification of pride and prejudice 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  Surprisingly, Enola Holmes' consistent fourth wallbreaks are no longer tacky and annoying, it is now fun and charming thanks to a refined performance from young star Millie Bobby Brown. Enola the character was better written in this sequel because her spunk, attitude and strength is evident throughout. I also applaud pulling more screentime for Henry Cavill as Sherlock, and his subplot is well linked to Enola's. All in all, the storytelling is easy to follow, the plot is intriguing to…  
Terrifier 2016;8; I don't usually care much for contemporary low-budget horror but this was really solid. I'm quite impressed by Terrifier to tell you the truth. No, the story isn't anything too special but the kills are vicious as hell. The gore effects are pretty damn amazing. Big props to these guys for actually going practical for a lot of it.Michelle and I will no doubt check out the sequel(s) in the future. 
Dune 2021;10;  "The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."I wanted something to blast me into oblivion, rattle my senses until I couldn’t feel anything else and also, y’know, capture my attention as a narrative enough to really care about what’s going on and get lost in it for a couple hours. It’s been hard as fuck, every single minute and hour and day since my wife went off into the dark in an ambulance.…  
Do Revenge 2022;10; women can be a little insane, as a treat. 
Incantation 2022;6; cool story sis but leave me out of this 
Aftersun 2022;10;  When your parents are apart, by way of separation, death or any circumstance, I wonder if the way you split your love moves with it. I'm thinking if, before my mother's death, my love for my parents was carved down the middle, 50/50, or if it would change depending on who I was around at the time. In Charlotte Wells' Aftersun, Sophie's love for her father weighs so heavily towards him, so doting and special, it's almost as if her…

Dune 2021;6; not bad if u ever just feel like staring at the color orange and not feeling a single emotion for two and a half hours 
Over the Garden Wall 2014;10; the best shows are those where a charming character is named “Greg” 
The Blair Witch Project 1999;8; Turns out that it was anya taylor joy all along 
Big Daddy 1999;6; Well, you’ve got Adam Sandler in slacker mode and delivering his typical brand of comedy in a movie that’s predictable, corny and far from the believable zone. Yet, there isn’t much boring moments either and ends up a harmlessly enjoyable watch with decent comical fun and heart. 
The Apartment 1960;10; this movie reminds me of why i love movies so much. it's a brilliant movie i could watch forever 
Where the Crawdads Sing 2022;6; The book is 1000% better than this adaptation. I found this to be rather cliché, and a bit of a bore to get through, so I would say skip this and just read the book. (Full disclosure: I have not read the book)2022 RankedDegrees of Kevin Bacon: 11.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  i’ve tried to write this review a handful of times since i watched but i just can’t seem to get my words together but here we go. this had me crying to the point i had to stop eating my popcorn, i was going through it skfjsj. this was a lovely tribute to a man who will dearly and forever be missed and loved. ryan coogler and everyone involved honored chadwick boseman’s passing & legacy beautifully and this is very special…  
Nightcrawler 2014;8; other than the fact that Louis is a ‘complex character’ its giving more shitty thriller movie than cinematic masterpiece 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; It would be an astonishing feat to put together a merely a decent follow-up to Black Panther in the wake of Chadwick Boseman’s passing but Ryan Coogler went ahead and crafted a full-blown epic masterpiece in Wakanda Forever, a surprising, mournful, and enthralling dirge that is Marvel’s most mature offering to date and my new #1.  MCU RANKED2022 RANKED

Pearl 2022;8; WHATDIDIDOWRONG!?NOWHYAREYOULEAVINGMEIFIDIDNTDOANYTHINGWRONGIDONTUNDERSTANDITHOUGHTYOULIKEDME! 
Our Century 1983;8;  Inundates the viewer with cycles of triumph and (disastrous) failure over and over again, starting back at the beginning of the 20th century and each time inching closer to the present. The obvious discussion to be had is if this is worth it, if there is progress being made and not just the illusion of progress, and even if the answers to these questions are a resounding "yes" then it makes sure we do not forget the cost of it…  
Tropic Thunder 2008;10;  Here we have a comedy movie directed by Ben Stiller (who also plays a role as one of the main characters here), which one enjoyed of a good popularity in the time it was released.Budget: $92.000.000Box office: $196.000.000It’s about the shooting of a war movie which was going to be based on true events.Tropic Thunder has such a big cast, full of popular actors like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Cruise or Matthew McConaughey and…  
Coco 2017;10;  Visualmente lindo, com uma trama emocionante e um roteiro afiado, viva - a vida é uma festa, traz uma mensagem reflexiva sobre morte, esquecimento, lembranças e saudade e ainda nos ensina a perseguir nossos sonhos e a valorizar nossa família.O filme traz a história de um menino que sonha em seguir uma carreira musical, mas nasceu numa família cuja a música produziu um trauma geracional que os fizeram proibir que qualquer membro seguisse nessa carreira, e invés disso, seguisse…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; “I’m a pair of boots with a rifle.”A meat grinder that feeds on young teens given recycled uniforms from slaughtered soldiers and told to fight and die “with honor” by powerful men who sit in rooms far removed from battle. Appropriately brutal and sad, even with a visual aesthetic and production design that is arguably too polished, albeit still quite gorgeous. 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; if i am killed by art the clown, do NOT prosecute him, because HE caught ME slipping! that is on ME! 
Pearl 2022;8; Mia Goth, thank you for making Brazil so proud of having an actress like you in Hollywood. You're a goat. That monologue scene needs to go viral, btw.  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; the harry styles dance sequence was the most unsettling part of this movie 
Werewolf by Night 2022;8; society if marvel actually used creative vision and put care in their other media [gunshots] 
TÁR 2022;8; A film so textually about interpretation where one person’s perspective (the titular Tár) is the sole formal focus. Why do we care about her? I guess because NPR, the New Yorker, etc. say so… Field leaves the audience to interpret the maestro, and instead of being momma beared through a film of black and white decisions and lessons, we’re left to decide whether we’re the ones who want to hold Lydia’s foot through the vacuous grey beyond, or if that’s actually just none of our business. 
Spencer 2021;10; kristen stewart is again accepted into a family of blood sucking demons, this time with horrific consequences! 
The Shining 1980;8; Marriage Story is a lot more intense than I remembered 
American Psycho 2000;8; I have to return some videotapes 
The Insider 1999;10;  "Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?""Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox!"A gripping, horrifying and first-rate tour de force. Mann, Pacino, Crowe, Plummer and every member of the supporting cast and crew showed up to play for this one. It's one of Mann's best works ever and it's one of the best of 1999 by a mile. I'd also like to express my support for the…  
Barbarian 2022;8; note to self: never visit detroit.THAT initial reveal from night to day and THAT tape measure is peak tension and absurdity. this has some of the most terrifying and hilarious theater experiences i’ve had in a while. a rare perfect buildup for traditional horror, too. the less you know what to expect the better. 
Girl, Interrupted 1999;10; pls someone get lisa chapstick 
The Royal Tenenbaums 2001;10; The scene with Richie Tenenbaum is in the bathroom while Needle in the Hay plays....powerful stuff. It gives me chills every time 
The Woman in Black 2012;6;  i can distinctly remember when this came it was considered by many people a breath of fresh air that someone made a spooky gothic ghost story about loss instead of another mid/late-2000s obnoxious gorefest. obviously plays a bit differently now after a decade of having the popularity of those trends basically reversed but i do think it's still quite solid in its recreation of this type of old-school production design and creepy atmosphere, and probably stands as one of the…  
Thrashin' 1986;6; “Thrashing, it’s just an aggressive style of skating. We thrash.”“Well, what do you thrash?”“Whaddya got?”“Oh god. Do you think you’re a wild one or something?” 
The Faculty 1998;6; 53Harry Knowles jumpscare 
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 2005;8; this is a really elegantly-crafted kids' movie. the isekai fantasy quality makes it feel so dreamlike and full of immersive childlike wonder. the memorable iconography is nailed, everything involving the wardrobe is just exactly how you would've imagined it, and they even managed to make Father Christmas work onscreen. it's just really well-done. 
Goodnight Mommy 2022;4; They did this remake just for Lea Michele cuz she can't read subtitles and wouldn't understand shit from the original. 
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;10; A stringless independent wooden puppet asking a brainwashed fascist general who controls him? This is my Pinocchio. The best Pinocchio so far, probably.Guillermo del Toro always gets it right with the portrayal of individuality and love in totalitarian regimes. It's not super faithful to the Collodi story, yes, but who cares? This is the way del Toro sees it, it doesn't pretend to be the original, and it's beautiful.Every fairytale should feature a singing and narrating Ewan McGregor. 
Detention 2011;6;  #SlasherSaturdayThere’s lots to like about this wild, frenetic, genre bending, pseudo slasher. Tons (and I mean TONS) of 90’s references and film references, off beat humor and creativity here. That being said, it’s a little odd that I didn’t like this more. Mostly, I think it’s because the first half didn’t quite work as well as the second half. The first half is so scattershot with the fast pace edits, lightening fast dialogue that I felt like I had…  
Blood Delirium 1988;8;  "Blood Delirium" is an Italian gothic horror film that formulates in a style and sensibility of being high art but is inevitably grounded in a surrounding of camp. As an ensuing result, it really becomes less of an undesirable mess to watch and more of a viewing experience that makes one internally ask themselves "What the hell am I watching?" but still stuck stationary watching the thing. It's somewhat acknowledging similar to the Herschel Gordon Lewis film "Color Me Blood…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; reviews seem to be mixed but i had a lot of fun watching this, and daniel radcliffe continues to be a delightfully interesting actor

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Wakanda Forever is a fitting n beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman, making his presence felt throughout while handling the grief n loss in a soulfully impactful manner. Set as clash of civilizations, the slow burn drama from Ryan Coogler is once again deeply political and is executed quite ambitiously with spectacular visuals, terrific action sequences, epic musical score and finely nuanced performances. The underwater set pieces were simply phenomenal. Among the cast, Letitia Wright and Tenoch Huerta stand out easily.…  
Showgirls 1995;8; Content Warning: You see someone's bare ass at 1:35:42 
Megamind 2010;8; There was a surprising number of kids terrified by this movie 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Losing someone of the magnitude of Chadwick Boseman was always going to leave its mark. But Wakanda Forevers shortcomings are sadly more pervasive than the loss of its titular star. The most recent MCU phase has been aimless, bloated, uninteresting—all criticisms I feel can be labelled at this film. As Marvel moves closer to multiverses, space-goblins, and its more fantastical elements it’s losing me. I don’t even know if Marvel has changed. It’s possible that Wakanda Forever is just as…  
He's Out There 2018;2; the slipknot drummer silences these very annoying siblings (thank you!) while all images are drenched into a chrome bath and get sucked out of all paint and ink. there is a still photograph from the set where the mask of the killer is gaily colourful, really cute and fancy. the end product - already punished by so many mistakes in tone, tempo and tension - looks more like a befuddled object of unsexy digitization. 
Searching 2018;8; I had this on my watchlist since 2018 and I was sure that it wasn't gonna be a good cuz it's a social media based movie and these almost always miss, so having an intesesing mistery is refreshing, it kept me on the edge of my seat and I kinda got so scared towards the end I rarely do that like ever so it's diffently a recommend 
The Return 2003;8; Boy, our father has no nameHe has no place inside your heart.A bleating spirit has he to youNo shelter in your soul.Damned to die betwixt the tidesExigent eyes: one thousand livesTired sighs ‘neath cumulus skiesWhere he’s been, we’ll never know.Against the years, a blight on youHis presence lost on me.To spare all sons the solitudeOf waves long lost at sea. 
Stronger 2017;8; jake's acting made me cry again.. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Ryan Coogler had to make the ultimate lemonade after so much went awry behind the scenes, none worse than the passing of Chadwick Boseman.The pivot and course correction resulted in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever being, in my view, the strongest Marvel film post-Endgame. It achieves that on the fact that it doesn't rely on Infinity War/Endgame ramifications alone.With the loss of its lead actor, this had the chance to make it about the women of Wakanda and they…  
RoboCop 1987;10;  I Know Who Killed Me (20 years before Lohan found out)Think I first saw this when I was 7 or 8 and rewatched it many times over growing up. Now it's probably every other year that I return to OCP's Detroit and can appreciate it just that little bit more each time, as satire starts to bleed into reality. It's a harshly layered tale of order and chaos, perfectly captured by Verhoeven and intricately portrayed by Weller.My favourite…  
Sliver 1993;6;  Early 90s erotic thrillers are just such a perplexing sub genre. The modern day film noir. But this time you can actually show the violence and the explicit sex. Somehow none of that really gels in Sliver. Part murder/mystery, part erotic voyeuristic sex games. It’s hard to buy into Sharon Stone and William Baldwin in this one because they have ZERO chemistry, probably due in fact that they couldn’t stand each other. Joe Eszterhas puts together some of the worst…  
The Woman King 2022;8; As you know, in lieu of another award season, next year we will be gathering all the living acting triple crown winners (meaning owners of an Oscar, a Tony and an Emmy) to physically fight each other for the title of Supreme Actor ™️. After the release of this film, Viola Davis replaced Dame Maggie Smith as the title’s heavy favorite. 
Theorem 1968;6;  I think one of the reasons I found Teorema so immensely frustrating, despite knowing that it's allegorical and political before anything else, is that, embedded alongside its determined profundity and the accompanying unmotivated, arbitrary behavior, there is — perhaps accidentally — a relationship of easy humanity, one that stands in stark contrast to the line readings that pass for relationships in the rest of the story. The one exception is the relationship between The Visitor and Paolo (Massimo Girotti, who…  
Men 2022;6;  Garland refuses to make simple movies with understandable structures and rather rely on coded messages and symbolism to guide our journey through what always seems a turbulent path to a final outcome which will never give you full answers and probably more questions. Hey that's not a terrible thing as long as the trip is engaging however I'm betwixt with in this vehicle. I think it looks solid and the two main actors are excellent and admire the style especially…  
Bullet Train 2022;4; Ryan Reynolds will pay for his crimes against cinema and art 
The Ring 2002;8; for a movie i last saw almost 20 years ago, i remembered so many images and plot points. liked it a lot back then as a slumber party flick that scared the shit out of me and my fellow pre-teen friends but i saw it on a print for the first time last night and i'm kind of blown away by how genuinely good it is (looks great too!). i love naomi watts in this — a beautiful blonde in a horror movie who is decidedly not a scream queen. she's bold and smart and compassionate and extremely resourceful (love when she's scanning gigantic library books).35mm. 
Pearl 2022;8; I haven't seen Smile yet but I know for a fact that none of the smiles from there will be more creepy than Mia Goth's smile. 
Run Sweetheart Run 2020;6; personally i would of ran the second he said he didn't like dogs 
Dreams in the Witch House 2022;6; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities-Episode 6I think what episode 5 and 6 prove is the immense difficulty to adapt Lovecraft. There’s only so much of the atmosphere that the screen can articulate and it feels like the story gets lost in the attempt to conjure the Lovecraft visuals. This was extremely apparent Pickman’s Model and while it’s prevalent in this episode, it’s not as detrimental. A slower start but I was all in during the finale sequences. A slower day for Cabinet but tomorrow is arguably the most exciting day. Plus, how about that Prior episode??? 👨‍🍳 😘 
The House 2022;8; anything that reminds me of Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids is automatically going to scare the shit out of me 
The Thing 1982;10;  *seen at the hollywood forever cemetery*the thing about horror films is that “rules” matter so much more to them than they do in any other genre. most horror movies have rules and explain them to the audience with expository dialogue (sometimes it’s subtle, sometimes it’s not, but the point is that in theory, the rules need to be airtight.) what makes The Thing so brilliant is all of the expository dialogue is a result of speculation, confusion, and human…

The Woman in the Window 1944;6;  If you’re Fritz Lang, you’re hardly in need of a rehearsal run in a genre you more or less invented. But if you do take a practice lap, it’s little surprise it comes out as solidly competent as “The Woman in the Window.” Like looking into the reflection in a pane of glass, “Window” mirrors a Lang film that would release just one year after it, “Scarlet Street.” Also starring Edward G. Robinson. And Joan Bennett. And Dan Duryea. In…  
Megan Is Missing 2011;2;  So I don’t know anything about this being big on TikTok and I can’t believe that even happened, but I watched it because I read an article on Dread Central talking about how it’s “one of the scariest found footage movies you’ve never seen” and I had NOT seen it so I gave it a go. I absolutely should have known better because I definitely would have heard of this if it was as scary as promised.No, this is…

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  A dark tale of friendships endAs Irish brothers fight an Irish War Of Independence with one another so too does Colm Doherty an aspiring musician. He no longer wants to be the friend of Padraic (I won't spell his surname) a simple and kind man who lives on the island with his sister and loves all of gods creations. The film is dark and serious, its frequently blackly comic and its intentions are intentionally ambiguous. Fans of the Coen's…  
Old People 2022;6;  Night of the Dead, but instead of Zombies you got evil and superhuman old people terrorizing a small town.This was very intriguing. Problematic, yet interesting. Although the grunting and ominous and creepy faces ended up being humorous at times, the old folks still managed to scare me and came off as these ravaging maniacs you don't want around, making this an otherwise simple premise that I think was mostly well executed. The direction, cinematography, and performances are all pretty…  
Heat 1995;10;  The one crime film to rule them all....Aesthetically cool, technically precise and an ensemble of a life time, all gracefully paced over near 3 hours.It deliberately parallels the psychology of the criminal and police both professionally and personally. Family and lovers add a contrasting weight to its band of obsessive perfectionists as a tableau of paranoid and lonely men.What takes the film beyond its procedural perfection and authentically charged action is an underlying elegy. It is a…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Emotions seem bigger in small spaces. When all you have are the four walls around you, loneliness and despair feel like they might drown you in your own home. The violent ricocheting of anger and shame within small communities can turn your life—and the lives of your neighbours and friends— into a battleground that lives on long after the memory of why has faded, and only myth and rumour remain.In choosing the Aran Islands for his newest joint, Mc…

Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; you harry stans can keep fighting for him all you want but none of you will ever convince me that he is a good actor. is he not embarrassed having to act alongside miss florence pugh?? and dear GOD that was such a lazy ending. how can you take such an interesting premise and turn it into something as mediocre as this? give me a break.still love you regardless, florence <3 
Two Evil Eyes 1990;8; Michelle and I watched Two Evil Eyes to celebrate makeup FX artist extraordinaire, Tom Savini’s birthday. The man does a great job here, especially in the The Black Cat segment. That was actually my favourite of the two stories in this Romero-Argento horror anthology. The cat handling in it was plain nasty though, it made me so angry. 
Election 2005;10; A near perfect gangster movie. It's kind of scary how good To is, considering that his filmography is littered with exceptional crime thrillers. I feel like Election is the first one however that can be talked about in the same breath as movies like The Godfather and GoodFellas. It really is that good.I urge everyone to seek it out. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; Lol, so dumb. Weird Al meets Hot Rod meets The Naked Gun. The early scenes with his roommates and the "take the shot" line absolutely killed me. 
Wendell & Wild 2022;6; Bleak, busy, cluttered, cold, creative, curious, detailed, goofy, sad, striking, uneven, weird, well-crafted, wild. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  All Quiet on the Western Front is a war film that shows us the nightmares of the first World War while being visually stunning.At the beginning we meet a group of young people who have been hypnotized by the propaganda and want to go to war. With full pride they want to experience an adventure and return as heroes. But when they arrived, it looked completely different than what they had imagined...Most of the scenes are done really…  
Aliens 1986;10; A feminists delightNewt, Ripley & The Queen form a trinity of innocence, good & evil as women inherit the galaxy. It feels a little more tired than Alien and lacks the horror and stylisation of it’s predecessor. That said the quality of the action led by mercenaries armed to the teeth and picked off by a nest of Xenomorphs is a huge level up for the original and it works all the way to the climactic head to head. Cameron uses Bishop as a rebirth of artificial life used for good. He would resurrect this sentimental idea again in Terminator 2. 
Kill Bill: Vol. 1 2003;10; she really just had that giant sword on the airplane 
Frankenstein 1931;10;  Frankenstein (1931) is one of the greatest horrors to ever grace the silver screen. From the very first frame you are drawn into this dark and disgusting picture of man attempting to overthrow God as creator in this world. Before that you get a little introduction into the movie by Edward Van Sloan warning audiences of the early 30s to be prepared to be horrified. I have no doubt in my mind that this film was a shock to the…  
Black Adam 2022;6; my favorite part of the movie it was when the m3gan trailer showed up before the movie started 
Amulet 2020;6;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberLong I did notice the poster for this film around town for a while, I never gave it much mind and occasionally got it mixed up with another film titled Jezebel or something similar. But now that I've seen it, how do I explain it? It's very intriguing. It's the latest in a series of horror movies, and its ending is both bizarre and inventive. Unfortunately, the ending is one of those…  
Rosaline 2022;8; this was super enjoyable i missed movies like this 
Piggy 2022;8; a pretty solid revenge film. I really liked the actress who played sara. The bullies deserved it. 
Argentina, 1985 2022;10; Saw at the venice film festival premiere. Cried like a baby. This film takes you through the trial against a fascist regime and cruel crimes against its citizens, with a most surprising lightness. It documented family values, the power of community, and justice, all while maintaining a sense of humor throughout. I wept for argentina and the heros that defended it. “it didn’t work. You did shine.”“Never again.” 
The Exorcist 1973;10; 12 year olds are just like that 
Battle Royale 2000;8; not a cell phone in sight, just teenagers living in the moment 
Halloween 1978;10; Got into an argument with a couple of 16 year old students of mine about how most of them have the attention span of fruit flies with ADHD and that most modern media seems to cater to their sugar rush needs causing them to lose appreciation for the power of simplicity.They disagreed.I showed them the opening scene of Halloween.That shut them up. 
Beau Travail 1999;10; oh my god 
Graveyard Rats 2022;8;  My favorite story by H.P. Lovecraft is Rats in the Walls. It’s very moody to start and becomes very macabre as it continues and for some reason the visual imagery in my head when I read it is beautifully dark, dreary, depressing, gothic nightmare fuel (i.e. totally my shit). Plus, it’s got a real banger of an ending. If you’ve never read it, I highly recommend it. It’s a short read well worth your time!So every time I see…  
Airplane! 1980;10; I get that a lot of the jokes may not have aged all that well for modern audiences, but this is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Top 5 all time comedy? Maybe. 
Nitram 2021;4;  What makes a film like this a bit of an impotent exercise in suffering is the fact that there aren’t any concrete answers to the problem at hand that is being examined, or at least, if there are, we haven’t found them yet.How am I supposed to have even a faint shred of empathy for Nitram and people like him? How am I not supposed to just hate him with every fiber of my being and wish he would’ve been…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6; "I hope you find love." 
Decision to Leave 2022;8;  Decision to Leave would've easily been the best movie of 2022 if it weren't for its last 30 minutes. Park Chan-wook once again demonstrated his directorial excellence and the two leads were exceptional, but the decision to resort to sentimentality proved to be deadly.For most of its runtime, Decision to Leave is a highly engrossing, tip-toeing mystery-solving process that combines humor and style. Despite its lack of shock values and an overdone premise of mind games between male cop…  
Deep Red 1975;8; Uses a brilliant cinematic technique where every time someone is about to die it plays the coolest music in the world so every murder scene turns into a dance party 
Duel of the Titans 1961;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn his second epic, Corbucci weaves mythology and history to tell the account of two brothers reared by a shepherd after being dumped by their mother and nurtured by a wolf. The brothers eventually lead a band of criminals in an attempt to defeat two oppressive kings. The story of how their mother's prophetic words lead them to seek the promise land, the land that will later become the…  
C'mon C'mon 2021;10; I can’t find the right thing to say that will bring it justice so I’ll just say that C’mon C’mon is beautiful and sincere and I loved it 
The Addams Family 2 2021;6;  Confirmed: Cousin Itt -at least on this film- is a fan of David Lynch. The original animated feature starring the iconic family wasn't exactly one of my favorites, which is why this sequel never piqued my interest and kept me from seeing it until now. And, while it has its moments and the story is lovely, I feel like the message is identical to the previous one. I also felt that the entire picture was rushed, there is little time…  
The Omen 1976;8; what a lovely picturesque family, i sure hope nothing involving the bastard child of satan happens to them! 
Pearl 2022;6;  Ti West and Mia Goth are knocking it out the park with this ongoing low budget X trilogy. The second film ‘Pearl’, while personally not as good as X, is still a nice addition to this years great horror slate. Mia Goth is once again phenomenal as our lead, her monologue to Missy is one of the best scenes this year, truly phenomenal stuff, and, thankfully, the kills, while few, are once again great, and the new 1918 setting works…  
Morbius 2022;4; matt smith dancing should have been the whole movie 
Cold Skin 2017;8;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now “We are on a tiny island of what we know, surrounded by an ocean of what we don't.”Now that’s the life. Isolated away from the world where you can live your life banging your fish girlfriend.I’ve been hounded by coworkers demanding I watch this for months and I certainly get why. As a lover of water based horror films, H.P. Lovecraft, and isolated locations, this is right up my alley.It’s like…  
Real Steel 2011;4; inexplicably saw and/or heard most of this during physical therapy for my IT band injury. weird Hugh Jackman era. DNF but got the gist 
A View to a Kill 1985;8; Maaaaax?!MAAAAAAAAAAXXXX!!!! 
Britannia Hospital 1982;6;  "Britannia Hospital" is a British dark comedy that was released in the early 80's. The film is, in actuality, the capstone in Director Lindsay Anderson's trilogy of films that revolve around the misadventure life of Mick Travis, a role portrayed by Malcom McDowell. Although within this film he is a side character intermixed within in all the various events of the film, each film in the trilogy catches his character in three different stages of life in three very distinct…  
Ludwig 1973;10;  Barry Lyndon, The Godfather and Fanny & Alexander do not exist in a world without Visconti. Ludwig is an epic tale of a King torn between the sensual pursuits of the self and the duty to kingdom and God. It isn't interested in aligning the "Mad King" to history, he's not that kind of king. Instead we look inwards as Ludwig becomes a recluse, imprisoned in his castle of treasure, surrounded by the young handsome grooms that accompany him in hedonism.…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; extra half star for the whales 
Little Shop of Horrors 1986;10; One of the very few, very rare movies you can literally call PERFECT in every way. My only suggestion, go for the directors cut with original ending. Flawless. Amazing. Iconic. 
Barbarian 2022;8;  Barbarian apresenta uma estrutura narrativa dividida, mas que se conecta de forma fluida ao longo do filme. Inicialmente conhecemos duas pessoas que alugaram a mesma casa em sites diferentes e que devido a confusão acabam pernoitando no local, em seguida descobrimos que a casa pertence a AJ, um ator decadente que quer vendê-la, pois está enfrentando acusações de estupro e precisa conseguir dinheiro pra pagar o processo.Em seu primeiro ato, o filme é carregado de tensão, o suspense é…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  Enola Holmes podrá tener sus pequeños problemas como la mayoría de cintas en la industria, pero ambas películas me han encantado. Con esta secuela ya nos adentramos más en ver cómo Enola saldrá adelante como detective tratando de salir de la sombra de sus hermanos, también veremos cómo lidiará con los problemas de ser una joven mujer en una sociedad dominada por hombres que dudan de sus capacidades.En verdad me encanta el personaje, siento que Millie Bobby Brown es…  
Hocus Pocus 2 2022;8; this was my avengers: infinity war 
Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story 2022;8; We can all agree that DAHMER - MONSTER: THE JEFFREY DAHMER STORY is a terrible, mouthful of a title, right??? 
The Batman 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Never in my life I would’ve thought Batman fighting against a redditor and it’s community would be one of the best superhero movies.  
Hocus Pocus 1993;8; Max: what happened?Dani: a virgin 🙄 lit the candle 
Train to Busan 2016;8; the whole movie is just an allegory of what it feels like to take public transport to school every morning 
The Exorcist 1973;10; Someone get this girl some chapstick! 
It Follows 2014;10; Sex? Cancelled. 
See How They Run 2022;8; It is more than enjoyable and entertaining. But this rookie director got a little over the top with Anderson's "inspiration." To the point where his film has no essence of its own, but instead replicates Anderson's style. I love this film, but I would have liked to see something that felt authentic..Either way, it delivers on the entertainment and gives me my needed dose of Saoirse Ronan that I already needed.Final score : 78% 🍎 
The Outside 2022;8; This was cool change of pace from the first 3 episodes.  A satire vanity and beauty standards, Kate Micucci gives a really wonderful performance. It’s campy and certainly a bit on the nose at times, but still manages some effective strangeness and body horror. Martin Starr is also really good as Micucci’s husband. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. Kate Micucci and Lawrence Fishburne in Rudderless2. Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon in Mystic River 
Barbarian 2022;10;  i'm so happy to say that i've finally watched this. i feel like i've waited so long and it was 100% worth it. there was never a point in this film where i could even guess what was going to happen next. there's just so much to love here.it doesn't take long for them to ramp up the tension but once justin long shows up, it gives us a nice break. seeing him measure every wall of that basement…  
Barbarian 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I wanted to watch a movie while working a long weekend shift, but was too tired to intake new information. Also I wanted to watch this when I could pause it and check out details I may have missed in the theater, like Zach giving himself a THIRD cameo (when Tess is looking at her Instagram in the cafe, she's looking at Zach's profile hahaha)!I really like Justin Long's anti-arc, meaning he seems like he will learn something, and…   
The Falls 2021;6; Probably my favorite portrayal of post-pandemic life in how secondhand its presence is yet its effects are felt rippling throughout the day-to-day mundane. At its core is an incredibly affecting relationship detailing one struggle of a single mom and her child and the complexities that role-reversal entails, and – although certain film-making decisions ham this concept a bit past relatability and into a mawkishness – it resolutely drives forth Chung Mong-hong's recent marriage of socioeconomics and melodrama.An extremely "nice" movie, in basically every sense of the word. 
Cat Sick Blues 2016;6;  Ahhhhhh.... yeah? WHAT THE F***?I really don't know what to say, there's no words for whatever this is. Ahhhh... it's a slasher. And the killer wears a black cat mask, and a massive dildo and he kills his victim by raping them or something. Clearly this s**t was made by a dog lover. Or maybe that's how weird male cat lovers are in Australia. And the most bizarre thing is by the end I was almost crying when we…  
Werewolf by Night 2022;8; I definitely knew Michael Giacchino could make beautiful music, but beautiful... Halloween specials too? Respect. Now I want to watch Van Helsing again.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked8/10 
Deadstream 2022;6; Maybe the real demon in demonetization was all the stupid shit we did for clout along the web. 
Pearl 2022;8; This dropping on digital the same day as Taylor Swift’s Midnights makes so much sense.It's meHiI'm the problem, it's meAt teatimeEverybody agreesI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirrorIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-heroRANKED: Spooktober 2022RANKED: A24 Horror 
Saint Maud 2019;8; An absolutely phenomenal performance by Morfydd Clark. The Lord of the Rings series was smart in casting her as Galadriel after this. She’s a star. This was such a bleak and depressing movie. Great horror elements. 
Funeral Parade of Roses 1969;10; "There's something wrong with me todayI feel like i've been abandoned by life for a long, long time'' 
Rosaline 2022;8; "Rosaline" could not have bet,Romeo would meet Juliet.And looking above,She sees her first love,On a balcony she won't forget. 
Nosferatu 1922;10;  Nosferatu. 1922. Directed by F.W. Murnau.100 Years of Vampire Films Thanks to Nosferatu (1922) and Bram Stoker. Nosferatu (1922) is a unique take on the supernatural Dracula horror film. In fact, it was the first ever screenplay of of Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel. However, Murnau could not afford the rights to Bram Stoker’s Dracula, so, we were gifted with a entirely original take on the story. In 1922, F.W. Murnau and director of photography, Fritz Arno Wagner shot the…  
Halloween 1978;8; how is this the only time they've ever made that mask look scary? 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;2;  the contemporary american cinema's utter failure to produce a single interesting statement on the rise of alt-right-wingers and an unironic ideology of pro-misogyny in a post-internet world is a damning indictment of its incapacity to engage with real, meaningful issues. as we delve further and further into the tepid resignation that the multiplex solely exists for corporate fantasy sagas and awards-bait, films like don't worry darling begin to take on a certain pathetic character, as if its half-baked observations and…  
Barbarian 2022;8; One of the most effective horror movies I’ve seen in a while.  I’ve had my eye on this one for a minute, well before any trailer dropped because of Zach Cregger.  Being a huge fan of The Whitest Kids U'Know, I was very curious and skeptical of him directing this kind of film.  Boy, was I wrong!  It grabs you by the nuts and never lets go.  I’ll be sure to have some nightmares tonight.  I can’t go above 4 stars because it’s a PSA for everything that you shouldn’t do in a life or death situation, but it’s damn good! 
Decision to Leave 2022;8; Not saying anything about the plot but this had the best editing and shot composition I've seen all year 
Lost in Translation 2003;8; For the sake of science, I am going to take the most liked review of this movie, Google Translate it into Japanese, then Google Translate it back into English. Let's see what happens.Original review by Lisa Bettany: "Who doesn't love a movie that starts on Scarlett Johansson's bum?"Lisa Bettany's review Lost in Translation: "Who starts in the ass of Scarlett Johansson, you do not love movies?" 
My Policeman 2022;8; i definitely wasn't expecting to love this film so much WOW 
Octopussy 1983;10; I’ve seen this film about 100 times and I still can’t tell you exactly which egg is fake and real. 
Not Like Us 1995;8; A quirky, alien invasion/abduction comedy produced by the king of b-movies, Roger Corman. Not Like Us has plenty of things going for it, most notably fun, colourful characters and excellent 👽 prosthetic work/ practical effects. It also has women exposing their boobies, a lot, which is always a plus in my opinion.I really dug the small town vibes. 
Bullet Train 2022;6; aaron taylor johnson in his tuxedo and cockney accent says jump and i say how high 
Speak No Evil 2022;8; it's been a little more than 2 years since becoming a parent quickly, completely, and irrevocably rewired how my brain perceives movies (in addition to just about everything else). this might be the first new release i've seen since then that features a moment i couldn't bear to watch because of that. you'll know it when you see it. but also the movie is really funny at times, in a hardcore discomfort porn sort of way! anyway, this is an endorsement. 
Death Becomes Her 1992;8; this film is looking camp right in the eye 
Hubie Halloween 2020;10; When Adam Sandler caught 3 raw eggs in his thermos then drank them and then instantly projectile vomited, all while riding a bike within the first 3 minutes of the movie starting, I knew I was watching a masterpiece. 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;10; I have high expectations since I based the entirety of my personality on Sophie when I was like 11/12/13 
Scream 1996;8; I hope one day ghostface calls me from outside my house and quizzes me on random celebrity knowledge so I can finally utilise the hours I’ve spent pointlessly scrolling through google and wikipedia pages. yes I know the names of the two children of the guy who sings the song american pie, next round bitch 
Set It Up 2018;8; im just a girl.. standing in front of a screen.. begging for netflix to make more romcoms like this 
Girl, Interrupted 1999;10; jared leto is in EVERY fucking 90s movie when will he leave me alone 
Take Out 2004;8;  Sean Baker is now a pretty famous independent filmmaker and with this movie you’ll find him at the beginning of his career working with no budget. Take Out is a revelation of indie cinema and one that feels so authentic to its material. Baker is known to cast non actors in his movies to make them feel as real as possible and he does it here as well. His neorealist style is put on full display here making it feel…  
I, Tonya 2017;8;  ✅84%Margot Robbie Ranked list - HERE“All I know is skating … I’m no one if I can’t skate … It’s like you’re giving me a life sentence.”Films based on true events make me think a lot. That's actually always my expectation with a biopic, that at the end it can leave me with a questioning face, rushing to my mobile phone and searching the internet for over 1 hour for more information, pictures or videos.I, Tonya…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;4; dude next to me ate good and fell asleep. save the blue ppl for avatar 2. seoul chase, killmonger and soundtrack from the first more memorable tbhpossibly the weakest cinematography and goofiest editing from a mcu flick. shit looks ripped from 123movies. final battle has its moments, but such a bitch to sit through2022⏩ autopsy (2022) 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Well it’s better than love and thunder 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; I’m amazed at what was achieved without our Black Panther. Wakanda Forever is a beautiful and touching ode to Boseman. I love its emotional and universal themes of family, loss and how grief can consume us. It’s feels overstuffed which took me out of it a bit but the production design, performances and action are superb. 
Turning Red 2022;2;  Turning Red is thematically and metaphorically confusing. If the panda was supposed to be a symbol of puberty, then why did they sell it to make money? Isn't selling pictures and hugs of a young girl turning into a woman kind of... Creepy? Why did she get blackmailed into performing at a birthday party by an 8th grader, and agree to it with no hesitation because of money? Why were the older women simply able to channel their pandas after…  
Ticket to Paradise 2022;8;  I didn’t think I’d get to catch this in theaters but ended up with free time today & wanted to see it before it left theaters. I got out of this what I wanted. It’s definitely just your standard rom-com. But that’s enough for me & I wish movies like this got made more often these days. This made me chuckle a bunch & brought a warm smile to my face on several occasions. That may sound over-simplistic, but that’s enough for me…  
Sick of Myself 2022;8;  Joachim Trier meets Ruben Östlund. Sick of Myself shows the horror of being a narcissist in the most Scandinavian way possible. It's not an instant classic, but it's more than enough to put director Kristoffer Borgli on the map.Episodic in nature, Sick of Myself follows the bizarre journey of a young woman desperate for attention. A compulsive liar and daydreamer whose sole purpose of existence is recognition from the outside world, Signe goes to extremes to outshine her artist…  
House 1977;8; Mordacious Pop ArtHouse (1977) is a phantasmagoria of inconceivable kitsch and drivel so uncompromising of a psychoactive fever dream, thanks to director Obayashi’s experimental bizarreness, absurdity, and architectural horror. “It’s unscientific, unexplainable, unnatural, unreasonable. It doesn’t make sense.” And it doesn’t have to. 
Falling for Christmas 2022;6; i can't believe all of that happened in 4 days but whatever, our redhead queen is back!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; A return to form for Marvel. Very sad in parts for obvious reasons but still a great movie. 
Trucks 1997;4;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now In the wide world of crappy Stephen King stories, how did his one about sentient killer trucks manage to get made twice?Listen, I spent my night at a Halloween party and indulged in some booze, then came home and watched this. I’m putting more energy into writing this like I was sober than this film deserves.It’s killer trucks. But not as goofy as you’d want that idea to be. It’s dull and…  
The Watcher 2022;8; Unfortunately, the end is frustrating, and it is not at the level of the rest of the series, which preferred to build and build and then leave without answers.The series is full of problems, of course, but they were able to make me see it all in one day. This is something to be respected.Until the last episode, I preferred to doubt all the characters of the series that they are the watcher, including the victims themselves.Final Score : 80% 🍎 
Beetlejuice 1988;10; Good LORD young emo Winona Ryder 🤤 
Michael Jackson's Thriller 1983;10;  Darkness falls across the landThe midnight hour is close at handCreatures crawl in search of bloodTo terrorize y'all's neighborhoodAnd whomsoever shall be foundWithout the soul for getting downMust stand and face the hounds of hellAnd rot inside a corpse's shellThe foulest stench is in the airThe funk of forty thousand yearsAnd grisly ghouls from every tombAre closing in to seal your doomAnd though you fight to stay alive…  
Barbarian 2022;8; The best Wes Craven movie Wes Craven never made. Gleefully perverse, genuinely fucked up, wildly entertaining, more than a little subversive. Maybe the wildest genre film of '22. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; dumb and surprisingly actually VERY funny in a few spots and finds a way to exist in a universe where Walk Hard already does. what else do you want man! weird al is my guy!! he’s not jewish but it’s antisemitic to hate him. sorry 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  Nothing could fit the life and music of Weird Al Yankovic more than this bizarre little flick, a movie that acts as a spoof of the musical biopic, playing on the tropes that you would expect from these types of films. The movie is at its best when it’s being incredibly self referential, the movie is written by Yankovic himself so the movie can surprisingly be super self deprecating at times and that adds to its charm throughout. Not all…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; the period drama, mystery-solving edition of fleabag somehow coming back with a sequel that is wittier and laced with more charm than it’s predecessor. netflix are truly in their bag with this 
Conflict 1945;6;  Any innocence of man is only deliberate blindness to his own temptations in “Conflict.” A Humphrey Bogart vehicle the actor made for Warner Brothers only after the studio threatened the star with his own contract, “Conflict” has an unremarkable script that nonetheless pinpoints a turn in the momentum of the noir genre. Filmed in 1943, but not released until 1945, there are early hints at what would become postwar male paranoia over gender inadequacy in “Conflict.” Bogart spends the film…  
Lo smemorato di Collegno 1962;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciCorbucci returns to the racy comedy genre with a film about a man who suffers from amnesia and finds that regaining his memory is the least of his problems, as many of his dark secrets begin to follow him and attempt to put him behind bars.Totò is back as this chatty, shameless and loud personality makes him a somewhat endearing character thanks in large part to his magnetism.…  
Scream 1996;10;  The sequels may have worn the concept a little thin, but the original Scream still feels like a breath of fresh air. Unlike many slashers, Scream isn't just a churned out movie formula all thrown together quickly. It feels like a carefully constructed movie, with a deliberately subversive streak. Obviously the meta elements are not so original now, but Scream is more than just a meta slasher. It functions essentially as a whodunnit, more focused on mystery than kills. The…  
Barbarian 2022;8;  i can totally see how watching this film in a packed theater could've leveled it up, but obviously i can only speak to how i felt watching it alone at home, which is...i liked it, but that's it? i thought it was well-made and solidly entertaining, i just don't get all the absolute raves. (again, this is totally from a home perspective!) basically i had a good time watching it - particularly the first half, with its "is the guy…  
Mortuary 2005;8;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now “That which is dead… cannot eternal lie. With strange eons… even death may die.”This film holds the record for the most unnecessarily stressful doorbell ringing in cinema.Didn’t think I was going to jive with this for a while but eventually the characters and manic zombies really win me over. I mean, it’s about a mold that turns people into “intelligent” zombies and there’s a Sarlac Pit underneath the cemetery. I’m always here…  
TÁR 2022;10;  It's all in the way the small sounds make the loudest noise, upsetting a balance that seems too perfect. If there's anything else that makes Tár feels every bit as visceral as it does, it might just as well be best stated by moments of silence, especially as they come into contrast with the loudness of the orchestrated music - because of how much it reveals about Lydia Tár in turn. She has total control of the music because of…

Scream 2 1997;10; No cops at pride just Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell with their guns

Gerald's Game 2017;6;  Stephen’s King’dom Marathon: Film #87”Let’s go in and get comfy.”I'm writing this write-up with my right hand, nestled snug around a glass of whiskey. Three drinks later, and my brain still doesn't work quite right, and it still hurts to write. But that's good. This write-up should hurt to write.So here we are at year number three of my Stephen King marathon. And Gerald's Game is the first watch of this third round. And even though I…  
Cruel Passion 1977;8; The umpteenth adaptation of the marquis de Sade's Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue that I have seen. Cruel Passion is a drama with heavy nunsploitation leanings. It naturally contains a lot of nudity and (lesbian) sex. Tonally the movie is all over the place, with it being jovial one minute and harrowing the next. The ending is especially bleak.Notable for being one of Roger Deakins' first cinematographer gigs. 
The Autopsy 2022;8;   Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities - Season 1 - Episode 3 Millbrook is a small town, plain as Jane. That is until people begin to go missing. Then a strange object shaped like a grenade of sorts, triggers an explosion in a mine, killing some of the miners on shift. Long time sheriff Nick Craven calls in his old friend, Dr. Carl Winters, to do the autopsies on the bodies. Dr. Winters is dying from cancer, but answers the…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  “We’ll all die at some point.”Stunningly beautiful cinematography and stark portrayal of WWI. The score is modern and oftentimes jarring. When the war is over, the movie doesn’t end there. There’s really no excuse for a film to be about two and a half hours long. However, the movie is effective and executed very well. A character says, “15 minutes to go” when the movie’s over in about 15 minutes. Practically all the horrors of war are shown. I’d…  
Halloweentown 1998;8; their mom is literally a whole witch and was like “please god let my children grow up to be accountants” 😭 why would you wish that mundanity on them woman 
Scream 2 1997;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  as soon as he listed “mickey, the freaky tarantino film student” as a suspect i said YEP THAT’S THE MURDERER

Misery 1990;10; so much pain and suffering could have been alleviated by annie wilkes discovering fan fiction. 
Amélie 2001;10;  A fellow introvert 😀👍Now I know why everyone talks about this movie. This felt a lot like a Wes Anderson’s movie and sadly I don’t usually like the way he makes his movies apart from The Grand Budapest and The Royal Tenembaums but I loved how this was filmed and the story was fantastic I enjoyed how Amelie helped to make everyone happy and ended up finding her perfect Match someone who’s quirky and also keeps them-self to them self…  
The Outside 2022;6; When people say Cum is good for your skin they really do mean it 
The Medium 2021;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberCo-written and produced by the man who brought us the fantastic "The Wailing," and directed by arguably (if not the) best horror director in Thailand with titles like Shutter and Alone, we have another incredible entry in the found footage genre where horror, religion, and the supernatural merge for a horrific film that also dwells on the themes of personal beliefs and the deadly consequences of karma. But none of that is…  
The School for Good and Evil 2022;6;  the obvious thing is that this just was designed to be a TV show. but even as a TV show it’d have its flaws. it’d be a much better arc, that’s for sure, but the script needed… work. i take it that this was quite loyal to the source material and… if that’s the case i just don’t think me and the author of the source material see eye to eye. it’d be impossible for me to cover everything i…  
May 2002;8;  Credit to Link Copp-Millward for putting this on my radar. This was a total blast. Angela Bettis kills as the titular May, a veterinary technician that struggles with her own socially awkwardness. Despite her own loneliness and isolation, May discovers that she has a sure hand at bringing other people together. This is such a fun flick. In addition to Bettis, Not Not Anna Faris is as delightful as ever. Really loved her in this. Worth checking out this hidden gem from. TW:…  
Evil Dead II 1987;10; and when i unironically call this the best movie ever made then what 
The Gray Man 2022;8;  I took advantage of cooling out on an evening where I had the place to myself and craved a "dumb fun" easy watch flick. Thus, I picked The Gray Man and...I had fun!Call me crazy, but I'm ok with the fact that not every single movie made can (or needs to) "break the mold" or be drastically distinct from everything that's ever come before. IMO, even if a movie's formulaic, formulaic's only a dirty word when said movie doesn't…  
My Girl 1991;6;  Wie wohl jeder von uns gewisse Filme mit einem Familienteil unlösbar verknüpft, ich etliche Filme wie „Leon – der Profi“, „Es war einmal in Amerika“ oder auch „Herr der Ringe“ und unzählige andere Genres deren Aufzählung die A4-Seite sprengen würde mit meinem Papa, verknüpfe ich mit meinem Bruder Filme wie die „Jason Bourne“-Reihe oder unsere gemeinsame Entdeckung getrennter Schlafzimmer mit „Chaser“, sind Werke wie „Fackel im Sturm“ oder sämtliche 90er Werke mit Julia Roberts eng und unlösbar mit meiner Mama…  
The Most Hated Man on the Internet 2022;8;  You know you are a true c**t when Anonymous out of all people go after you.Apparently, I missed out on a tragic but morbidly exciting moment in the early '10s, like, I knew about the entire revenge porn part, but I didn't realize there was a king and a website dedicated to it all, so the whole documentary was quite enlightening, but also extremely infuriating and enraging, largely because of this piece of shit known as Hunter Moore. The…

The Ice Storm 1997;8; Everyone's dealing with Ice,As more than a plot device. While they freeze,A bowl of keys,Is really a roll of the dice. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  It’s absolutely horrifying for the MCU to make an out and out masterpiece, one of the finest people to ever set foot on a movie set had to pass away before his time. The fact that they actually are capable of performing at this standard, on both a purely technical level and writing a story with texture, with character and emotional depth but chose not to is fucking infuriating. I guess you could call this the Dark Knight to the…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Well guys, we’ve made it through phase 4. It doesn’t really FEEL like the end of a phase the way the last ones have, but at least it ended with a good movie. The way they transformed this script after the passing of Chadwick, and loaded it with tons of emotion and compassion, you can really feel the care they put in come through. They even took the time to finish the VFX this time. I liked how the theme…  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;8;  Although Gomez has subsequently opened up about her mental health struggles, “My Mind and Me” gives us an unpolished, real-time view of the events of the last six years. We may know tidbits of what happened, such as her bipolar diagnosis, a kidney transplant for her lupus, philanthropic work, and a busy acting and music career. Still, Gomez doesn’t hold back in this documentary.Even though Gomez’s life has been covered every which way from a young age, Keshishian manages…  
TÁR 2022;10; cate blanchett was so good in this that i'm still not entirely convinced lydia tár is not a real person 
How the Grinch Stole Christmas 2000;4; Most actors do less mugging in their entire careers than Jim Carrey does in any individual scene in this movie. It is sort of fun to contrast his energy with the dog playing Max, who looks like he’s performing while someone just off-camera is aiming a gun at his head. Otherwise ...not fun. 
Stars at Noon 2022;8;  Riffing on the theme of corporate colonialism with a hot and heavy dose of horny takes a delicate hand. Fortunately, director Claire Denis has one of the most deft hands of all modern cinema auteurs. But, there even comes a time when the most well-honed serving of high cinema sexiness still comes down to a matter of taste. Denis, back to her semi-autobiographical early career works on French Colonialism in Africa, has used her proficiency in the medium of physical…  
Till 2022;6;  For those worried, this is sensitively told in a respectful and gracious manner. It’s undoubtedly moving but I think its sadly telling when I was most moved by the text in the closing credits as opposed to the actual film.Danielle Deadwyler is good, perhaps a little overhyped for me. She has some incredibly powerful scenes but I’m not sure she ever felt like a fully realised character.This also can’t help but feel like a Wikipedia page turned into…  
My Own Private Idaho 1991;10; so sad scott doesnt roll up with the lgbt 
Fall 2022;6; Could’ve been an automatic 5 stars if when they zoomed in on the RV, Walter and Jesse just walked out. 
Donnie Darko 2001;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   “so what do i tell the other kids when they ask about you?”“tell them that everything is gonna be just fine”donnie darko is still maybe the most brilliant movie i’ve yet to see in my lifetime. on the surface it can be cold and achingly confusing, weaving a plot that hardly leaves dots to even connect. but peeling back it’s layers, reading lengthy articles, rewatching it again and again and again, it proves to be a sickly sweet…   
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; The Black Panther movies use grief as varying coats of paints like Lego Movies do with daddy issues. Not to say, this wasn’t stellar nonetheless though. 
Pickman's Model 2022;6; Liked this mostly for the excellent creature work. They looked wonderfully nightmarish. Plus, how do you not love Crispin Glover doing a weird accent?  Not much to sink into beyond that, but I think the production values on this make it worth checking out especially if you’ve been enjoying the rest of Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. Crispin Glover and Laura Dern in Teachers2. Laura Dern and Kevin Bacon in Novocaine 
The Viewing 2022;10; Guillermo del Toro's new series was mostly underwhelming (with a few exceptions) .. and then Panos Cosmatos blew my socks off with this one. Holy shit I loved it. Between Mandy and this ...god damn, we need more stuff from this man stat 
Aftersun 2022;6; Please don't hate me but this just did not work for me on virtually any level. I'm glad people enjoyed this tone poem/heartfelt look at a beautiful father-daughter relationship/understated coming-of-age tale/vacation movie. I was ready to be immersed! It's great that everyone is loving this movie and please don't let anything I say detract from your experience. But I found it dreadfully boring and its gestures towards the broader significance of the events depicted to be woefully underbaked. The one thing that worked was Paul Mescal's performance. His barely suppressed anguish is the heart and soul of this film. 
Wendell & Wild 2022;10;  CREW SCREENING AND WRAP PARTYLast night, for the first time in my life, I got to see my name scrolling up a theater screen in the credits of a movie. I can't even begin to describe how surreal that felt. The feeling in that room, getting to watch this with the people who made it, it was electric! And I feel very fortunate that I got to be amongst such a talented crew and got to learn from them.…

Chungking Express 1994;10;  I love the stupidity of holding on to what has moved on.I love the smallness of the biggest emotion we know.I love the pain that doesn't seem to leave but you know somehow it will.I love seeing love.And I love how Wong Kar-Wai manages to capture all of the above and mold it into a piece of visual poetry, instilled with the melancholy, pain, joy, frivolity and promise our species' most powerful four letter word possesses.…  
Barbarian 2022;8; no thoughts, just bill skarsgård 
Saw 2004;8;  “I’m sick of people who don’t appreciate their blessings.”Here we have the first movie of this big franchise, well known for its sadistic traps and the psychological terror it portrays.It’s about two men who find themselves trapped in a room for no reason, after listening to a couple of tapes which were prepared for them, they know that the game began.It’s a good movie, it has a premise that is always interesting for the viewer, it’s quiet…  
Terrifier 2 2022;10;  Turning Gore into ArtEvery so often a movie comes along that seems like it was tailored just for you. Ever since my first viewing of Halloween (1978), the slasher genre has been my bread and butter. Halloween is one of my top 3 films of all time. An indie darling back in the 70s, a perfectly crafted film that uses suspense and anticipation to scare the viewer. For a film that kicked off the slasher boom of the late 70s…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  ENGLISH below🔪Eines gleich vorweg, "Halloween Ends" hat mir besser gefallen als sein Vorgänger, aber es ist kein guter Film und die Grundidee des Films, wenn ich es so nennen will, ist einfach bescheuert. Warum also 2 Sterne und nicht nur 0,5 Sterne? Ich habe so ziemlich alle Teile dieser endlosen Horrorserien wie "Nightmare on Elm Street", "Freitag der 13." und "Halloween" gesehen, um nur ein paar zu nennen. Und Leute ganz ehrlich, es gibt einige "Einträge" in dieser endlosen…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  "You should just give in" - Corey Cunningham, - 2022: boxd.it/eWNQo- Halloween Ranked: boxd.it/1IQzAI like Corey's dad's taste in movies. Warning: you need galaxy brain for this one. It's all about that trauma symbolism and weird choices and most people are going to hate it.... but I AM NOT MOST PEOPLE.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, Black Panther set such a high bar for a superhero film that no other similar genre film has so far been able to meet it. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, respectfully marks the passing of its previous lead actor, Chadwick Boseman, who tragically died of colon cancer in 2020. Boseman's legacy and all-too-short career had a tremendous impact on the world, and returning director Ryan Coogler and…

Entergalactic 2022;8; Muuy bonita, no esperé que conectara con una historia de amor más, pero no se queda solo en eso, además de la excelente animación, tiene muy buen discurso sobre las citas amorosas con reflexión sobre lo que el amor verdaderamente debe de ser.Es muy divertida y todos los personajes son muy agradables, amo que la mayoría sean puros mariguanos.Solo me faltó conectar más con el soundtrack porque no es mi tipo de música, así que en mi mente sonaron puras de Adele. Media estrella más por el sticker de Meryl Streep 
Aftersun 2022;10;  Very rarely do I see a film and immediately know it’s going to be one of my favorite films and one I want to see again as soon as possible. Police Academy Three: Citizens on Patrol is that movie*. I went into Aftersun mostly blind**, and I’m glad I did, cause every scene had my mind going in about fifty directions. The film is largely about a father and daughter on vacation. I’ll leave the plot summary there.There are plenty of…

The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993;8; Testaments old and new. It is accomplished. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  This is such an utterly amazing film and a beautiful tribute to the character of T’Challa and Chadwick Boseman. There is such a meditation and reflection happening here that feels very needed and is taken very seriously, there are only a handful of jokes and humor here and it is so refreshing to see a film from the perspective of Black women in this universe. And while we made not get to spend as much time with some characters as…  
One Piece: Strong World 2009;8; The Straw Hat crew coming in dressed in black is so iconic. These movies are starting to get better and better, and I’m so down for that! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; I’ll have to form words later because right now I’m a mess! 😭 just know that Angela Bassett, Tenoch Huerta, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright are incredible here. It’s an amazing tribute to Chadwick and I can’t wait to watch it again and again and again in a movie theater.(Peep the SECOND Rihanna song 😭😭) 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  For everyone who's hated all the humor and silliness in marvel movies recently this should be the antidote, if you still don't like this then it may be time to pack it in and call it a day on the MCU.I'm not a big fan of the first Black Panther, I think it's by far the most overrated film in the MCU franchise. Hopefully Ryan Coogler and the rest of the cast and crew sent a nice fruit basket…

Enter the Void 2009;10; if I did any drugs, I would see the H2O mermaids swimming with me 
My Policeman 2022;6; Sueño en otro Idioma le gana.No es mala pero es la misma historia de amor secreto de siempre. Tiene bonitos momentos pero se desaprovecha por lo mucho que se esfuerza en ser emotiva.Ojalá los personajes tuvieran mejor argumento sin caer en lo tóxico para que el tema de la vejez y los arrepentimientos se sintiera más deprimente y realista, ni modo.Espero Harry Styles siga actuando cada vez mejor cómo aquí y no lo digo solo por ciertas muy buenas escenas (🍑) 
No Bears 2022;10;  Speechless. With each new film, Jafar Panahi expands the boundaries of what cinema can be, and what it can mean. Panahi has put together an unbelievably impressive stretch of consecutive works since his filmmaking-ban was put into effect — and No Bears is right there among his best (my favorite). Every film since the ban has been a defining accomplishment in the medium, and a testament to his unwavering persistence, and to his belief in cinema and search for truth. No Bears is…  
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;10;                                   SOME SPOILERS For all the sequels that came after, I think what’s helped Wes Craven’s seminal original hold up so well is how sharply it captures just what it’s like to face anxiety as a teenager, using the fantastical conceit of a killer targeting students through their dreams as a clever way of exploring the upheaval and pressure that go with coming of age…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; 21 years later some mf really convinced all of Germany for a second attempt. 
Wendell & Wild 2022;8; Henry Selick,I am begging you to make more films 
Barbarian 2022;8;  Zach Cregger's Barbarian is a masterclass in building tension and suspense, and presenting payoffs in the form of well-crafted scares. Surprisingly, we also get to know just about enough about the film's lead characters including the antagonist. Almost every cliché associated with films featuring the "terror in the basement" trope is neatly subverted. We also get a great "final girl" performance from Georgina Campbell, which doesn't exactly turn out the way you might expect. The first act sets up the…  
Graveyard Rats 2022;6; Guillermo yelled "CUT!" but Vincenzo heard "RAT!" and went rabid with it.

But when Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell), an young man who has been accused of killing an boy while babysitting, catches the attention of Allyson, reignites a cascade of…  
Hard Boiled 1992;10;  John Woo’s Hard Boiled opens with the assembly of a mixed drink. First a shot of tequila poured into a glass. Then, a shot of soda being added to the same glass. Then the whole thing gets mixed when someone picks up the glass and drops it back down onto the bar.For all the talk about Woo’s love of birds, this series of images foreshadows everything that will follow: The film is about the alchemical reaction that occurs when…

The Cincinnati Kid 1965;8;  After seeing this film, I've concluded that Tarantino must have watched this movie when casting Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen. Not only is he an excellent actor, but he has the look of a young McQueen or, at the very least, he could be his (ginger) sibling.In terms of the movie, it was intended to be a comedy, but I never laughed. This Steve's response to Newman's classic The Hustler isn't on the same level as Paul's film. Having…  
Poltergeist 1982;10;  "Poltergeist" is a complete staple in the realm of horror. Following the story of a standard middle-class family that lives the average suburbanite lifestyle, the film follows the possibility of urban expansion disrupting the peaceful nature of those put to rest. As such, the congregated power of vengeful spirts muster enough combined energy to wreak havoc on one particular family, The Freelings. The film is a combination of a traditional ghost story, an introspective look at the paranormal research/psychic medium…  
Annie Hall 1977;10; fuuuuuuck youuuuu wooooody alleeeeen why is this one of the best movies of all time?? 
The Munsters 2022;8; all you need to know about rob zombie as an artist is that he unironically uses the impact font in this. total cornball goofiness with sincerely silly gags that deliberately run up against the contemporary meta-ironic sensibility, doesn't try to appeal to anyone who doesn't love junky horror aesthetics overclocked into neon-hell while all the characters compete with each other to say the worst joke imaginable. the munsters is the embodiment of pleb filter: either you're in on this stupid shit, or you're not, there's no in-between. 
Sympathy for Lady Vengeance 2005;10; I don’t think this is a popular opinion but Lady Vengeance, despite Oldboy’s violent extremity and frenetic action, is my favourite of the trilogy. What I find most fascinating about the work of Park Chan-Wook is his ability to illuminate elegance and beauty amidst endless brutality. And while its story features crimes of the most horrific nature, the film is indecently funny, a balancing act few directors can achieve with such supreme confidence and visual ambition. I am seeing Decision to Leave on Wednesday. The wait is killing me!

Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; An absolute masterclass in "overexplaining the mechanics at the expense of the metaphor". It's a very well shot movie though, so that gets it one star. And it has Kate Berlant, so that gets it a second star. 
Captain America: Civil War 2016;8;  The MCU adapts one of the most iconic comic book storylines of all time and they do a damn good job with it. Civil War is quite possibly the biggest thing to ever happen in the Marvel Universe and they found such a unique way to adapt that storyline under the guise of a Captain America film.

Licorice Pizza 2021;4;  a hang-out film that never stops running long enough to actually hang somewhere, annoyingly precocious and precious about itself, too-cool-for-school needledrop overkill. bradley cooper steals the movie because there simply isn't that much of a movie to begin with, which isn't to say that i don't enjoy the story of alana's self-discovery, i just wish this didn't overload that story with period detail and incessant detours, the near-constant tracking shots give off the impression of wistful interpersonal energy, but the…  
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984;10; So weird, I’ve literally been dreaming about this same dude in the green and red sweater. I’m sure it’s nothing, anyways good movie! Happy Halloween everyone!🧡🎃 
Barbarian 2022;8;  "There's always gonna be people that...that project, you know, some kind of dynamic onto us that serves them. It's up to us if we wanna play ball or not."Tess (Georgina Campbell) shows up late at night to her rental home. There's something odd about the place. Barbarian is an example of slick, compelling storytelling with real momentum and energy that shifts and changes in some genuinely unexpected ways. The script is smart and doesn't condescend to the audience or…

A Woman Under the Influence 1974;10;  All of a sudden, i miss everyonethis has got to be the most exhausting and stressful movie i've ever watched. it's like i was underwater for two hours and twenty six minutes. when the credits started rolling, i breathed again. there was not a second where i thought something bad will happen. this is undoubtedly a masterpiece, but going through this movie is emotionally tiring. if you are looking for a movie to be emotionally invested in, THIS is…

Nope no clue what could have occurred to create this thing. Huh. Don’t ask me. Wow. Totally stumped. Yeah… no idea. I got nothing. Nope. Noooooooooope. 
Elvira's Haunted Hills 2001;6; Its like the three stooges, but with bewbs. 
Prince 2022;4; Set in a fictional village, Anudeep tries to deliver a message on humanity blending romance-social satire-irony in his distinctively styled treatment of absurd dry humor using exaggerated characters. It does provide some good laughter whenever it gets the one liners and ironical blend right, but the romance and serious portions move in a flat manner, managing to offer only sporadic fun. The final 30 minutes was loaded with far more madcap moments with decent payoffs. Among the actors, Sivakarthikeyan and Satyaraj impress the most. Thaman’s music was good. On the whole, this lighthearted entertainer ends up a strictly average watch. 
TÁR 2022;6;  Art is real, and the enrichment it adds to people’s lives is as material as the harm done to people by abusers, these different types of material are difficult to weigh out fairly, and if you see people tweeting things like “Lydia Tár did nothing wrong!” it’s because Todd Field has created a safe space for us to mourn what gets lost in the triage when we (necessarily!) prioritize the untreated wounds of the directly harmed—a lament which runs against…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Yea man, fuck this town! First off I just wanna say fuck the audience at this showing, fuck the families that brought they sneezing and coughing toddlers, fuck the dudes sitting in the way back screaming anytime Micheal came on screen or talking to the film, fuck the guy sitting next to us who would get up ever other five minutes and say “Shut the fuck up.” to the kids in the front row and fuck you Haddonfield residents for…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6;  A few weeks ago I thought Blonde was gonna break Letterboxd but it might be Halloween Ends that does it.Halloween Ends, the 13th, yes you heard me right, 13th film in this franchise swings for the fences and it’s definitely a wild mixed bag. One thing I can appreciate is just trying something new instead of the same old formula. We get to see what the effects of Michael Myers have done to the mental state of Haddonfield. Often…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  This has been a good year for the MCU, with every theatrical film being a 6/10 - this might be the best. I like the general story of Wakanda Forever, which feels personal and passionate in its execution, looking at picking up after loss. After the loss of Chadwick Boseman, the film pays respect to the actor and the character without coming off as emotionally manipulative. Most of the characters from the first film are thrust into a lead position, and…  
The Lovers 1958;10;  "Can't you decide to be happy for once? What more do you need?"For those of us who have spent enough years absorbing the Law & Order franchise into our bloodstreams, we all probably remember Fred Dalton Thompson or Steven Hill citing Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous line from a ruling about obscenity: "I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that." What may not be as easily recalled about Jacobellis…

See How They Run 2022;6;  ENGLISH below"See How the Run" spielt in einem Londoner Theater, in dem seit vielen Jahren "Die Mausefalle" von Agatha Christie aufgeführt wird. Als die unsympathischste Figur des Films ermordet wird, lässt Inspektor Stoppard (Sam Rockwell) mit Hilfe der jungen Constable Stalker (Soairse Ronan) das Theater hermetisch abriegeln, da der Täter höchstwahrscheinlich noch im Gebäude ist. Wie es sich für einen Film im klassischen Christie-Stil gehört, ist das gesamte Theaterensemble verdächtig. Man merkt dem Film an, dass die Macher viel…  
Cornered 1945;8;  The tendrils of fascism creep across the globe and through the back most recesses of man’s mind in “Cornered.” The 1945 noir casts Dick Powell as an injured soldier who refuses the idea of a homecoming, instead setting himself about the task of traveling to Argentina to hunt down the Nazi who murdered his French wife. This detour to the south removes “Cornered” from the larger slate of post-war noir, which dealt with men who found themselves aimless on being…

The Mourning Forest 2007;8;  Using work as a distraction, life as a distraction, distractions as distractions, to push away the things we don't currently have the emotional energy to confront. It's easy to believe that we'll get to it soon, in the near future, one day, eventually, right after we finish dealing with whatever's immediate. But somehow there never seems to be the 'right time' nor the right amount of emotional energy we thought we'd have to deal with what we already should've. At…  
Persona 1966;10;  speech is an ever-present temptation when faced with the pure absence of the image, the ancient hermetic sorcerers and neoplatonists taught that true absolution and connection with the godhead was achieved either in the physical ecstasy of nonsensical actions and utterances, barbarous words, or in the solace of not-speaking, not-thinking, the emptying out of one's animal soul until it could be filled back up with the wholeness of divine spirit. but those are extremes, it's a long way to the…  
Mulholland Drive 2001;10;  No hay banda. It is all an illusion. Peak Lynchian surrealism. Dreamlike in quality, and infinite in it's interpretations. It feels unapologetically random, yet completely deliberate at the same time. Shades of Bergman's Persona and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard slip into our subconscious, yet the films chaotic tranquility creates a cinematic experience that is uniquely on it's own wavelength. David takes huge swings that define his one-of-a-kind style with Mulholland Drive, and it makes for a film that has stood the…

Magnificent Warriors 1987;8; David Chung’s Magnificent Warriors is part WWII movie, part Raiders of the Lost Ark adventurer, all action spectacle. Michelle Yeoh basically plays Indiana Jones in this. Derek Yee plays Indy as well. A double dose of Indy, pretty frickin' awesome! The fight choreography is out of this world and the stunts looked dangerous and painful.Very entertaining! 
Gli onorevoli 1963;6;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciBefore going on to Westerns, Corbucci gives us an anthology of humor that aims to satirize politics and politicians.The film, like every anthology, has its ups and downs, but its major fault is that, unless I missed something, it never makes it apparent that it's an anthology, and it bounces from story to story in a way that really ends up squandering, going from Toto attempting to win…  
Aftersun 2022;10;  One of the best directorial debut films that I've seen within the past few years: one that beautifully captures a sense of childlike innocence but ends up recontextualizing those memories as a means of reckoning with an empty presence within how we understood the world. Suddenly, all of those joys don't feel like such anymore, and our only instinct is to recreate what we can through how we perceived of those around ourselves, especially those whom we were close with.…  
The Woman King 2022;8; These sort of movies are not really my style. It exceeded my expectations though. Great action and a sensational performance by Viola Davis. While it did feel a little long, it’s a very well made movie overall.

Decision to Leave 2022;6;  Well that was... long. I've got a confession to make, never really been a fan of Park Chan-wook. I've seen quite a lot of his movies now, but I can't honestly say I've liked any of them. His segment for Three... Extremes is probably the closest I've got. He's one of those auteurs I just don't really get, not on his wavelength I guess. I think we all have a handful of these anomalies - directors who clearly have a…  
Rosaline 2022;6;  i was sold on this when i heard the concept and it was definitely a fun time though i do think its lack of commitment may be where it falls flat at times.i’m not the most critical on period pieces. i like modern takes and such, but i do think sometimes the writing here was a little too simplified and dumbed down both in dialogue and approach to the source material. sometimes it allowed for such funny moments i…  
Day Shift 2022;6;  This wasn't as horrible as I had anticipated. The second half definitely has its share of action, and the sequence with Steve and Scott is where the movie peaked for me. Foxx does his best, injecting a large dose of his inherent charm, but he's limited by a bad screenplay full of gags that are pretty much the epitome of lazy writing. Souza's performance as the villain is uninspiring, and the dubbing makes her sound like an abuelita. The soundtrack,…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10;  No idea what more you could possibly want from this movie. I mean, it shouldn’t even exist, how is it this funny? A parody trailer expanded to a feature over a decade later, shot in 18 days for a streaming service and it’s somehow the most joke dense movie I’ve seen in years? Like, I think this is probably on par with The Naked Gun, but I can’t think of much this century that matches it (maybe Barb and Starr,…

Triangle of Sadness 2022;8;  Sometimes while trying to regurgitate the corruptions of classism back from whence it came, it comes out just a little bit… like vomit. And some of that vomit can get on the chin. And on… more than just the chin. “Triangle of Sadness,” though, just winds up with a few dribbles at the corner of its mouth. Which, considering content and ambition, is a pretty respectable state. Director Ruben Östlund, with his slew of satires on the rich, might be…

While The Lighthouse is probably objectively his best film this is BY FAR my favorite of his so far. The atmosphere and tone are excellent and it's worth the watch for that alone. While I've never found this to be scary or frightening in the traditional sense of what you'd expect out of…  
Blazing Saddles 1974;8; Some of Blazing Saddles' humour is definitely dated but there were still plenty of moments that made Michelle and I laugh out loud.Little gave such a great performance here that it is beyond me why he didn't become a household name after this movie. Wilder is as charming as always and at his comedic best.I loved all the meta moments/ fourth wall breaking. The Hollywood conclusion was nothing short of amazing.A movie that could never be made today.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  This is a very engaging and well-done movie with a blockbuster-worthy story, great music, and bursts of really human visuals. Far and away the most cohesive project to come out of Phase 4.  I like that the introduction to the Talocan people is a little scary! And while I thought they went with a pretty unexciting choice to carry on the mantle out of all the options in this film (What can I say? I’m a Lupita stan for life.…

That was the question pondered through these past two years, following the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman, regarding the newest Marvel iteration. And it is with greatness and heart that Wakanda Forever comes to achieve those goals with success.…  
Apocalypse Now 1979;10;  Wow, I have been missing out hard on this masterpiece! I watched the Theatrical version for my first time but I’m definitely looking forward to Redux and Final Cut. Yeah, pretty much everyone in this was brilliant—amazing performances from the whole cast. Even though Marlon Brando shows up well into the third act, his presence was so powerful. The soundtrack was so badass too and I loved the use of “The End” (it might have just redeemed The Doors for…

Barbarian 2022;6;  Justin Long constantly, and I mean constantly, exclaiming “what the fuck, dude?!” is so fun even though I hate his character’s stupid guts in Barbarian. Barbarian is ultimately Malignant all over again for me. Something I see loads of people absolutely adoring and that I find ultimately far from something I’d offer my adoration. It takes its concepts to “balls to the walls” levels of “insanity”, which clearly work for many, even if I am not included in that. Furthering…

Um nicht zu viel zu verraten: als Zuschauer empfiehlt sich ein starker Magen, Erinnerungen ausgerechnet an „Werner Beinhart“ wurden wach. Bis zu diesem Punkt ist „Triangle of Sadness“ noch eine bitterböse Klassen-Satire, ein Frontalangriff auf die oberen Zehntausend, die High Society, ihrer absurden Manierismen und weltfremder Rituale.

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  ENGLISH belowSoweit ich weiß, ist dies die erste deutsche Verfilmung des Buches von Erich Maria Remarque. Der Film ist sehr unangenehm und ich werde ihn mir sicher nicht mehr sehr oft ansehen. Allerdings ist der Film zweifelsohne sehr hochwertig gemacht und Kamera, Kulissen, Make-up und Musik brauchen sich vor großen Hollywood-Produktionen nicht zu verstecken. Alles in allem ist der Film sehenswert und ich hätte ihn mir im Kino ansehen sollen. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass er in Wien überhaupt…

Deadstream 2022;8; Wow, this was a lot better than I was expected. What started out as annoying turned into a very creepy ride. It made me very anxious at times checking for noises myself. There was plenty of humour in there as well. Great stuff. Found footage is not dead yet! 
Final Destination 5 2011;6; still miss the chunky, squishy tangible gore and nu-metal era sheen of the first 3 but this at least deploys its gimmick 3D digital look/kills with a bit more animated glee than the last one (the gymnastics spinal break and laser eye surgery deaths are great) and builds to a decent finale concept that i was honestly surprised it took them this many films to get to. also has a goofy nonsense twist ending i had somehow completely memory-holed.

Your Name. 2016;10; i will never get over this moviei heard they are remaking it into a live action film😭 i hope they don’t ruin it 
Easy A 2010;10; olive’s parents being utterly perfect in every way was somehow the most unrealistic part of this film 
The Werewolf Versus the Vampire Woman 1971;8;  "The Werewolf Versus the Vampire Woman" is early 70's Spanish horror film featuring Spanish actor Paul Naschy as the often-recurring Waldemar Daninsky, a Count that has the ability to transformer in a Werewolf by the light of the full moon. Although Daninsky is a constant returning role for Naschy, the films aren't particularly connective, making each featured film more episodic or varied adventure in nature. Naschy would make twelve films revolving around the character, with "The werewolf Versus the Vampire…  
Badlands 1973;10; hilarious that the entire premise of this movie is just, “what if you overlooked the fact that a guy was insanely crazy because he’s handsome?” 
The Young Girls of Rochefort 1967;10; I genuinely cried. this is so beautiful 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Genuinely the single most baffling thing I’ve seen this year, every creative choice more confounding than the last, crescendoing into nothing, peak bozo cinema. Between this and Kills I need to know which brilliant creative minds decided that the main crux of this series is…. The collective trauma of all of Haddonfield against one guy and…. Mob Justice???? At least the 2018 film wasn’t afraid of playfully toying with slasher tropes, with its kills showing good timing on a moment…  
See How They Run 2022;8;  Why is the reception/marketing for this so underwhelming?! A meta whodunnit spoof about a film based on a play based on a book based on a murder mystery (really!). Like if Wes Anderson and Martin McDonagh made one of these things together - a fun little romp with no shortage of puns, dark humor, and quirky editing. Completely lax and inconsequential but still razor sharp, and what a cast! Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan play off each other very well,…  
Army of Darkness 1992;10; Probably my favorite of Raimi's trilogy because the main character is at his most entertaining here, and while I find this one's insane tonal whiplash and absurd out-of-nowhere concepts to be utterly at odds with the previous two films, they're silly and distinct and memorable and fun enough to make this film the most consistently engaging out of the three to me....but enough about Spider-Man 3. 
Crimes of the Future 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I’M SO FULL FROM MICROPLASTICS YUM  
Top Gun: Maverick 2022;8; Miles and Glen didn't kiss at the end so that's why i give it 4 stars. 
X 2022;8; literally just ONE of them needed to man up and have sex with the old lady and they all would have survived 
Romeo + Juliet 1996;8; you don’t go into this thinking there are gonna be two radiohead songs 
We're All Going to the World's Fair 2021;8; Eighth Grade but make it r/nosleep 
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;10; Easily one of my top horror films if not my favorite. The imagery is never not bold and horrific. The atmosphere is so claustrophobic and tense, sometimes it’s even irritating. Which makes for a consistently tense experience where, no matter how disturbing things might seem, you really never know what’s around the corner. The whole thing ends with an incredibly necessary space to breathe for both the viewer, the protagonist, and the killer (who is one of the weirdest and most interesting killers out there.)  Her final shriek says it all. 
Trick 'r Treat 2007;8; Sam: *brutally murders someone*Me: aw he baby 🥺 
The Conjuring 2013;8; This is a movie about sideburns 
The Truman Show 1998;10; the truman show was black mirror before black mirror was black mirror 
Call Me by Your Name 2017;10; imagine losing your virginity and you're wearing double denim 
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 2004;10; remus and sirius are the gay uncles i wish i had 
What We Do in the Shadows 2014;8;  Imdb trivia:The man who plays Stu is not an actor but actually Stu Rutherford, a part-time business analyst for a Wellington company, LanWorx. He was hired for the film under the impression that he would be working on computers, and that he would play a small part in the film.Stu is the purest human being alive, perhaps even of all time. This is a movie about Stu, made for Stu. I'm so glad the vampires realize this, protect…  
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004;10; I pray people get broken up with so I can recommend this movie. 
Piranha 3D 2010;6;  occasionally dips a bit too much into the garishness and obnoxiousness of its era even for my taste but the Big Setpiece is undeniably one of the best of its kind. so many gleefully disgusting details it genuinely becomes hard to keep track of them over the course of 30 minutes. i'm personally partial to the dude who in order to save himself starts running over dozens of swimmers with his boat chopping them into bits, and who eventually catches…  
Les Misérables 2019;8; This intense provocative drama stands out for the way it stays apprehensive all through, escalating the tension consistently into a grippingly explosive final act. The unstable volatile state between the cops and marginalized community is well depicted on screen. It doesn’t lean towards any strict opinionated judgements, rather leaves it to the viewers and ends on a powerful note with a thought provoking final message. Strongly recommended watch."Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators." 
One Way Boogie Woogie 2012;8;  Ostensibly filmed in Milwaukee, but like the previous two Boogie Woogies it seems indifferent to specificity. Such is the power of Benning who doesn't strip his films of their individuality insomuch as he, in capturing the inbetweens of his loci, creates a universal snapshot of American spaces. The 2012 version feels much more attuned to Mark Fisher's idea of 'hauntology' than the others, re-creating the shots he captured in 1977 and 2004 but in a much more somber, languid mood.…  
Hard Target 1993;8; Happy birthday to my favorite libras. Zac Efron, Jean Claude Van Damme and vikingp! 
976-EVIL 1988;4;  Ok, but has anyone tried texting 976-Evil???This was mediocre and boring. The pacing is slow, and the acting is terrible on top of all the unlikable characters. The script is all over the place. By the time evil calls back, you will be asleep. Robert Englund gets points for grimey 80s atmosphere, and its cute that he met his wife on set. But id rather have watched aunt Lucy being 60s style bougie with her 10 cats. I am…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  A twist straight out of an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Halloween Ends wasn’t at all what I expected. But I honestly kind of loved it. It’s ambitious as fuck and offers something different than the Halloween movies before it. Even though I enjoy a good amount of the Halloween movies, a lot of them are the same recycled thing over and over again. Halloween Ends is vastly different than the rest and I really appreciated that. My favorite of the David Gordon Green trilogy…  
Come and See 1985;10; I’ve been trying to figure out what to write but I can’t find the words. This was an experience unlike any other. Tears welled up in my eyes during some moments. It illustrated the truly deplorable nature of man. Extremely powerful and not for the faint of heart. Enjoy is not a word I would use to describe the act of watching this. However, I believe it’s an important film for anyone to view. Even if you only have the faintest trace of empathy, you will feel it in your bones, and for that it is a masterpiece. Thank you camile for the recommendation. 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;4; As a publicist, Selena needs to fire her team. They absolutely do not protect her and check in with her about the press she needs to do and it so obviously turned her away from her career for a while. Also, I wish this doc wasn’t so corny with the interludes because I truly believe she has beautiful insights to say, but the doc showcases more of how poorly she picks her inner circle and how little they support her than a cogent narrative. 
Funny People 2009;6; A dramedy that’s a bit long and gets draggy beyond a point, yet the strong show from the fantastic cast makes it for a decent watch. 
The Viewing 2022;4;  ENGLISH below Zwei Drittel des Films sitzen ein paar Arschgeigen rund um RoboCop Peter Weller in einem interessant aussehenden Raum herum und labbern uninteressantes Zeug. Lediglich in den letzten 20 Minuten tut sich dann auch wirklich was. Eine Story ist eigentlich sogut wie nicht vorhanden und auch wenn der Regisseur von „Mandy“, Panos Cosmatos, sein visuelles Gespür erneut demonstrieren konnte, hat mir „The Viewing“ nicht zugesagt. ⬇️⬇️⬇️ E N G L I S H ⬇️⬇️⬇️For two thirds of the…  
Blended 2014;6; It’s got a straightforward storyline with a narrative you know exactly where it’s heading towards, yet it’s that kinda silly comedy that turns into your guilty pleasure comfort watch. Some moments are dull and it has your usual cheesy peasy stuff, however the pair of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler share a great chemistry and keep the show rolling. A fun time pass entertainer. 
Barbarian 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  She just needs a babyYou can be a baby for herSo She won't be lonelyShe gives her breast milk to a grown man💀  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Definitely my favourite entry in the David Gordon Green trilogy. I really like this new take on the Shape: Michael Myers as an entire town's shared trauma. The movie certainly isn't perfect, but I do think it mostly succeeds at what it sets out to do. It annoyed me the least out of the new movies, that's for sure.I doubt this will be the last we will see of Michael Myers, but I wouldn't have a problem with it…  
Walking Tall 2004;6; It’s a superficial predictable old school style action drama, but Dwayne Johnson walking around with lumbar wood and smacking the shit out of people is so damn cool to watch. Johnny Knoxville adds to the fun. Though it has nothing memorable to offer, at just around 75 odd minutes it’s an easy time pass watch. 
The Love Butcher 1975;8;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now “I am love, total love. I am Lester, and I am alive!”So tonight I was going to finally sit down and watch The Last House on the Left only to realize I didn’t I didn’t have a way to watch it. Scrambling to find something to replace it, I come across this collecting dust on my shelf. Figured it was God’s way of saying it was time to check it out, and here…  
No Mercy 2010;8; A solid dark mystery thriller thats loaded with plot twists n unexpected turns, though at times it did give a feel of overdoing it with one too many. But nevertheless, it stays engaging and keeps you hooked all through. The bloodshed was heavy as always with brutal pathological detailings and an unsettling finale. Entire cast deliver good performances. Though nothing exceptional, it’s another solid entry into Korean revenge drama list. 
TÁR 2022;10; a true mastárpiece 
Misery 1990;8;  On the eve of my birthday, I wanted to watch a slam-bang crowd pleaser of a horror movie with my wife and I figured it was long past time to finally check out Misery, apparently one of the most successful Stephen King adaptations and a movie I'd heard about my whole life yet managed to somehow avoid for nearly forty years. It was kind of a perfect choice: we've got the story of a famous writer captured by the embodiment…  
Deadstream 2022;10; Just a goddamn hoot. This whole thing hinges on whether you find the beleaguered youtube streamer host too annoying to watch or not, but he worked for me. Impressive amount of cool gross monsters + nasty physical comedy. Silly fun! I love that we're getting more goofy horror movies lately, i missed them. 
TÁR 2022;10; It’s not hyperbole to say that Cate Blanchett gives maybe one of the greatest performances I’ve EVER seen in Todd Field’s TÁR, a chilling character study of a famed conductor and her fall from grace - fueled by her own hubris and self-obsession - directed with Kubrickian control. At 158 minutes, it may be seem like a daunting and demanding watch to some, but there wasn’t a single second where I wasn’t entirely enthralled.TL,DR: Cate’s coming for that third Oscar.2022 Ranked 
Blonde 2022;2; if you watched this movie for ana de armas, you may be entitled to financial compensation

Mulholland Drive 2001;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Hey pretty girl, time to wake up."There was a time not too long ago when if you asked me what my favorite movie was I might have told you Mulholland Drive. There's a lot going on in the film and I certainly won't claim to understand all of it (something I might have done when it was my "favorite movie"), but I do have a reading of it that seems to answer a lot of the questions it poses,…   
Doctor Sleep 2019;8; [Facebook memory import]"It was a solid horror, I enjoyed it. You felt its length but there was nothing superfluous about it, everything was necessary and I was never bored...” 
BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;4; Idk what’s up with Netflix movies and fetuses this year but I’m losing my mind 
X 2022;6; This movie is about the most horrifying thing imaginable: old people are still horny and looking to fuck.I'm never quite sure if I admire or am annoyed by Ti West's slow burn, patient approach to horror, but at least in this one there was a lot of really hot women getting naked while I waited for the movie to go murder mode. Indeed Mia Goth is featured in not one but TWO of the hottest fuck scenes in years! 
Fantastic Mr. Fox 2009;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  everyone is like "oh ash is totally me!!!". ok i'm the evil little rat voiced by willem dafoe who ends up dead in a sewer  
Call Me by Your Name 2017;10; So strange that life goes on after finishing a film like Call Me By Your Name. 
In Bruges 2008;8; I love movies. In Bruges has a clear cut identity with rich, developed characters that occupy a world entirely unique to its director/writers sensibilities. This movie came in and just wowed me with how fun it is, but also how McDonagh uses a melancholic atmosphere behind all of the farce. If you like hit men comedy films look no further than this one, but be prepared to have your heart touched as well. Great cast, cinematography, and directing. I cannot effin wait to check out Banshees. “It’s like a fuckin fairytale or something.”  
Beetlejuice 1988;8; 🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃"It's showtime!" ... happy Halloween everyone!For me Beetlejuice has to be Tim Burton at his most creatively raw and imaginative point, with his one of a kind quirky gothic style. The musical moments are my favorite, but I just wish it had even more Beetlejuice ... Beetlejuice ... Beetlejuice!Thanks for reading.Happy Halloween movie watching ... BOO! 🍻 
Pearl 2022;10;  Es increíble el diferente tono que tiene Pearl en comparación a X, ya que esta película se centra en explorar varias facetas del personaje que conocimos en la película anterior. Hay una gran diferencia de cómo empieza a cómo termina, y eso se puede notar en varios aspectos de la película, por ejemplo los colores, la paleta de colores de Pearl es completamente diferente a X, y esto va representando con el estado de humor de la protagonista, y cómo…  
Halloween 1978;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  me and my buddy happened to catch John Wick 3 on the hotel TV directly before this movie. imagine our surprise when *both* movies ended with a character being shot multiple times in the chest before they fall off the top of a building to the ground and then disappear before anyone finds the body. michael myers has john wick powers. or maybe vice versa.  
The Book of Boba Fett 2021;6; They realised halfway through than no one really cares, so they just switched to Mandolorian halfway through 
Sextette 1978;10;  Pure camp. A musical with a star studded cast that is as glamorous as it is over the top. Mae plays an actress/escort who seduces world leaders for the US government. But shes finally found love with her 6th husband Timothy Dalton. Unfortunately on their wedding night her pesky studio tries to meddle by having her tempt a Russian oligarch, do a screen test for a movie, one of her ex husband's shows up and on top of everything else…  
The Rundown 2003;6; A generic action adventure that stays enjoyable all through regardless of its shortcomings, thanks to the kickass over the top action sequences and few humorous banters. Dwayne Johnson is rock solid and his fun chemistry with annoying Seann William Scott keeps the show rolling. If you’re up for having a pretty good time with some entertaining mindless action comedy, then just grab some popcorn and go for it.

Halloween Ends 2022;6;  Don't be fooled by the rating, I kinda liked this. What sucks is the conflicting baggage that ultimately makes this experience so damn frustrating.Let's get this out of the way. 'Halloween (2018)' is the PERFECT goodbye to this franchise and the following sequels are completely unnecessary. While the 2018 film itself is a bit messy, you can't help but love it because of the incredible 3rd act climax. Seeing these women overcome their generational trauma to defeat their abuser…  
Halloween Ends 2022;2; What IS wrong with this town? Send in the National Guard at this rate because these guys are beyond helpAlso what was with the choice to turn Allyson into the worst judge of character of all time? She was really done dirty here 
Monica 2022;8; AFI 2022: film #10“what’s your name again? please remind me”i wish there was a bit more dialogue, maybe along a slightly longer timeline, but it manages to say so much while still keeping an air of mystery that adds an emotional weight to every scene. and such a lovely and tender performance by trace lysette 
The Hunger Games 2012;10; if they made this today tom holland would’ve been cast as peeta 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6; I feel like this is the set Tom Hanks was supposed to be on instead of Elvis. 
Eyes of Laura Mars 1978;6; Solid American Giallo featuring Tommy Lee Jones as an unfrozen caveman cop who can’t appreciate any art besides cave paintings. 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;4; i don’t think anyone in my showing actually thought this was a good film but it was also only the second time i’ve been part of raucous applause in the middle of a movie so maybe this is the next Avengers: Endgame 
Clerks III 2022;2;  Some notes:- The emotional high point of this movie for me came in its opening seconds, when Dante (Brian O’Halloran) arrives to open the Quick Stop and Randal (Jeff Anderson) strolls out of the neighbouring cannabis store (formerly, of course, a video store). I loved Kevin Smith’s original 1994 Clerks when I was a teenager and watched it many times. If you show me the guys from that movie looking older, I’m going to feel a little emotional.-…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; The not so "Thin Red Line" between "Come and see" and "Destroying Private Paul". Should actually be seen as loud and as big as possible. Elaborate, intense, rich in futility. ======================================================================"Der (nicht ganz so) schmale Grat" zwischen "Komm und sieh" und "Der Soldat Paul Bäumer". Sollte eigentlich so laut und so groß wie möglich gesehen werden. Aufwändig, intensiv, reich an Sinnlosigkeit.

True Romance 1993;10;  "True Romance" is a prevalent 90's action/crime film that is known to many, carrying with it a huge prevalent fan following. It is action packed, highly stylistic, and has excellent showcasings of acting within the application of its dynamic script foundation. It uniquely also showcases two clear personalities within in film, who's stylings work in succession with each other in tandem uniformity. We get the narrative story of Clarence and Alabama Worley, two young lovers who fall head over heels…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Ryan Coogler does an admirable job of navigating a way forward for the world of Wakanda through the grief and pain of Chadwick Boseman passing along with dodging all of the intertwining stories in the current over-bloated MCU which sinks most of their films. By making a film that simply deals with rising to the occasion in a moment of pain and not having to connect the shit that happened in this show to the bullshit that happened in this…  
Planes, Trains and Automobiles 1987;8; I can’t believe John Hughes wrote not only one of the definitive Christmas movies, but directed also one of the definitive Thanksgiving movies. My cousin: 7/10🔙 Halloween II🔜 Good Will Hunting 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  2022 UK Releases RankedMCU Ranked“Our King is dead. The Black Panther is gone.”I had high hopes going into this movie, and it actually managed to exceed them. Ryan Coogler manages to pay tribute in the best possible way to Chadwick Boseman and his legacy, while also paving way for the future of the Black Panther franchise and the other characters within it. I honestly think this tops the original, with brilliant characters, performances, and a true heart…

The Big Heat 1953;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   M is probably Lang's best, but this is my favourite. Is there any actual difference between "best" and "favourite"? I don't know. Phones are open.The scene where Lee Marvin throws the coffee in Gloria Grahame's face is one of the hardest in an Old Hollywood movie. So is the scene where Grahame throws coffee back in Marvin's face. And so especially is the scene where Glenn Ford's wife gets murdered. Just shattering. What did Lang know about wives getting…

I'm not going to say anything regarding the plot because even though i have so many thoughts on that, i just don't feel like saying anything about that at this point.... this truly hit my heart! i left the cinema with my…

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 2016;10; “No matter what you tell me or tell yourself, you’ll ultimately die fighting these bastards. So what I’m asking is this. Wouldn’t you rather give it all at once, for something real than carve off useless pieces until there is nothing left.” 
Blood Beach 1980;4; I was expecting someone to start shouting "there's a shark in the sand, get out of the sand" but no one did, such a wasted opportunity right there. Apart from that, it would have been nice if the movie decided to be either horror or romance because both didn't do the trick for me. 
The Lodger 1944;8;  There is little doubt about the culpability behind “The Lodger” (1944). The Jack the Ripper inspired noir of the same title as its 1927 Hitchcock predecessor… is no Hitchcock film. But what it lacks in Hitchcockian moral and structural complexity, “The Lodger” makes up for in being a minor epic of the morbid and grotesque. Hitchcock’s silent take on Whitechapel’s most infamous killings left the guilt of its title character as murky as the London fog. The 1944 version’s director,…  
V/H/S/99 2022;6; I truly love how the V/H/S series has been still kicking and allowing genre artists unleash a little. My favorites in this one were Roberts “Suicide Bid” (genuinely scary), Macintyre’s  “The Gawkers” (felt the most real to the period) & The Winters’s “To Hell And Back” (most inventive and funny) but all of them had something fun and fucked up to chew on.Hope this series goes in until they’ve exhausted every year from 1980 to 2000.

I loved the film, however, I also expected that it be a little more disturbing and tell more about what he had recorded on those tapes and about the woman…   
The Shining 1980;10; This film’s about a lot of things, but for me it’s about being a creative, imagining all you need to achieve greatness is remove all the distractions in your life, doing so, and realizing actually it’s you, you’re the reason you suck. And then of course acting totally normally with that information.

What We Do in the Shadows 2014;8;  I wish Taika Waititi would go back to making movies with his friends! This is his best work in my opinion. I feel like his best sensibilities are present in movies like this one, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and Jojo Rabbit. He's a bit in over his head with all of these big budget blockbusters in my opinion. The comedy flows so well with the well crafted mockumentary structure. Everybody performing in this movie is aces and has a great…

Scream 1996;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  amazing how every moment in this movie is simply iconic. drew barrymore’s 10 minute cameo where all she does is run around and get killed? legendary. every line that came out of tatum and stu’s mouths? incredible. billy and stu’s suggestive murder partnership? show stopping. and not to mention literally everything my girl sidney did!in conclusion this movie invented the genre, everyone else should just stop trying

Doctor Sleep 2019;10;  Have you ever watched a movie that feels like it "gets" you? Like, it just somehow caters to your distinct personal taste, wants, and preferences?Doctor Sleep (Director's Cut) is that for me. Further, it encapsulates damn near everything that I adore about horror as well as movie-watching in general. Ingenuity. Investment-worthy characters. Strong, believable performances. Fascinating lore. Incredible world-building. Consistently engaging storytelling. A meaty narrative - issa full meal with dessert. Earned tension, terror, and narrative payoffs.This rewatch…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Corey's screwed. He's got a domineering mother and a hen-pecked father, who sadly tells him "I hope you find love". The town hates him. Is it possible to love someone with Corey's past? Maybe only for someone who's also been through trauma. The type of life-changing tragedy the average person doesn't understand and selfishly makes their own in a form of self-righteous hate. Allyson, Laurie Strode's granddaughter, is trying to move on after losing her mom and dad in the…

The Big Sleep 1946;10;  Howard Hawks' incredible adaptation of Raymond Chandler's classic detective story stars Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe, who finds himself in the middle of a complex web of murder, blackmail and deceit after taking on a case for decrepit patriarch General Sternwood. It's a brilliantly well executed film. The script is full of sharp lines and witty dialogue, which keeps the whole thing entertaining while the convoluted plot rolls out in front. There's a vast array of colourful characters, though the…

Barbarian 2022;8; Decent as creepy horror films go. The director sets the tone and atmosphere very well. Performances are fine. Difficult to write about with no spoilers. Some twists and turns, a few lazy tropes and jump scares but overall it's worth watching. 
Pearl 2022;8; she’s so real. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; #WEIRDTheAlYankovicStory might be one of the biggest surprises when it comes to a comedy. A straight parody on biopics/music industry that incredibly turns everything upside down like Weird Al did for the music genre. IT’S BRILLIANT… Daniel Radcliffe is GREAT but Evan Wood is 🙌🏻The only reason the film is held back by going 5/5 is some of the story feeling paced together as sequences & Sketches than an actual full story but GOD WHAT A BLAST OF A TIMEFULL REVIEW HERE  
Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi 2022;8; Dave Filoni fucks with the canon for an hour and a half and it’s glorious 
Punch-Drunk Love 2002;8;  irritates the shit out of me but i still enjoy it, PTA's denial/release logic of film-as-orgasm finds a sharp expression in sandler's genial autistic restlessness, allowing the tinny wavering of jon brion's score to carry our anxieties across the vastness of the californian horizon-lines drawn in hardwhite heat. i don't really buy the romance itself, but i buy the romancers, which is good enough, and as with everything he's in, philip-seymour hoffman has the best role and the best performance,…  
The Taking of Deborah Logan 2014;8;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now “She puked fucking earthworms”Props to the guy that realized shit was getting to weird and bailed out of the film. That, ladies and gents, is how you survive a horror film.I’m a sucker for found footage and finding a good one is cause for celebration. Using the format as a documentary on Alzheimer’s and slowly realizing it’s something much more evil is ingenious. It explains why they’re recording everything and the Alzheimer’s…  
Poltergeist 1982;8;  Movie: PoltergeistDirector: Tobe HooperRelease Date: 4 June 1982:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:\/:Poltergeist is so 1980's, but I would say that this is generally a large positive. The heavily dramaticized suburban lifestyle is a focal point of Poltergeist, with the aesthetic (of course, when initially released, it was not considered an aesthetic) romanticizing it even further.Of course, the core strengths of Poltergeist lie within the house itself. The strange occurrences within the house keep the viewer moderately engaged, wondering what…  
Black Adam 2022;4;  I wanted to say three things here:The first is that I want to congratulate this movie, it's the first superhero movie that puts me to sleep (and that's almost impossible to happen),The second thing is that I feel a little sorry for the team that did the CGI for this movie, it turned out amazing, but the editing guy certainly didn't know what he was doing,And the last thing is that I feel sorry for Noah, the…  
The Novelist's Film 2022;8;  It feels odd to single out a Hong Sang-soo movie as being especially “personal” — it’s not as if any of the prolific Korean auteur’s playful, recursive, and relentlessly idiosyncratic micro-budget work has been withholding or made for hire — but “The Novelist’s Film” hits a bit different than many of Hong’s recent ditties. Why is that?Despite being a little breezier than “Grass,” more accessible than “Introduction,” and more fluid than “Hotel by the River” (to namecheck just three…  
Halloween 1978;10;  ENGLISH below🔪Ich würde gerne behaupten, dass es bei mir und "Halloween" Liebe auf den ersten Blick war. Aber das wäre eine Lüge. Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern, dass ich, als ich "Halloween" zum ersten Mal sah, bereits "Das Ding aus einer anderen Welt", "Nightmare on Elm Street" und "Freitag der 13." gesehen hatte. Als Teenager hinterließ "Halloween" daher wenig Eindruck bei mir. Für mich war der Film nicht aufregend oder blutig genug. Nun, mit dem Alter kam…

Frances Ha 2012;10; "I wouldn't eat a domesticated dog""You say that just because they're cute'' 
The Farm 2018;2; Most awkward acting I've seen in a while, messy script and unlikable characters I couldn't care less about. They're treating humans like animals but for what purpose. Some background story would have been nice but at least it has a short runtime. 
Halloween Ends 2022;6; The opening scene sets up some great ideas but I can’t express enough how much I LOVED the idea but the fact that this film hinges on one character so much that was never set up before this film hurts the trilogies finale 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;8; happy to report that this movie actually feels like a real movie and that miss flo absolutely carried she is the reason why i go to the theatre you know to watch something on the big screen

Dead Poets Society 1989;10; calling ur dad “father” is just a socially acceptable way of saying “my dads a bastard and i hate him”

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; Why does this feel like a bunch of DISNEY+ television episodes stitched together? 
Terrifier 2 2022;6;  There’s stuff I like about this. Some of the lighting, the score, DTH’s performance as art, the Final Girl. But man this is a big old, half-formed, Kickstarter mess of a movie. A real, “hey, we got way more money than we expected and the pandemic afforded us way more time than we thought we’d have, so let’s just throw a bunch of nonsense in here for shits and gigs!” Cut that whole stupid dream sequence for crying out loud.…  
Demons 1985;8;  My Half Hooptober"You don't think it's going to be a horror movie, do you? You know I just hate them!"The central image here that unlocks the rest of the film for me is the woman trapped behind the theater screen mid–demon transformation desperately clawing her way through the thin membrane. Demons aren't real, they only exist in the movies, and yet here, "It's happening just like in the movie!" "We gotta stop the movie!" Demons are incarnations of…  
The Virgin Suicides 1999;10; THE ORIGINAL SUICIDE SQUAD. 
The Fog 1980;10; The vibes are immaculate. Essential flannel shirt cinema. Carpenter the 🐐 
Cemetery of Terror 1985;6;  #SlasherSaturdayDecent little supernatural slasher to go along with spooky season. In a way this felt like two different movies. First half follows a serial killer raised from the dead that stalks group of partiers in an abandoned house. The second half follows a group of young kids venturing through a cemetery that get chased by the dead emerging from their graves. It’s kind of like the Spanish mashup of Halloween and Night of the Living Dead.  On the downside,…  
Lot 36 2022;6; I don't have much to say about this. A reasonable start to the anthology series, hope things get better from here. Didn't love it, didn't hate it, though it could have been shorter - doesn't really have THAT much going on. Solid demon design! 
Black Adam 2022;2;  I know this is me politically nitpicking but I couldn’t think of anything else whilst watching the film. Black Adam makes a point over and over again that the fiction country of Kahndaq (based in North Africa) is under occupation and has been harmed by foreign intervention but never once does the film actually deal with this? The citizens only rise up against a hoard of zombies created by one of their own, and the mining of natural resources is…  
V/H/S/99 2022;8; Folklore and groupthink somewhat inevitably converge at the dawn of a new millennium. This batch of stories is consistently fun, lovingly dressed for maximum ‘90s nostalgia, but Flying Lotus’ “Ozzy’s Dungeon” is easily the masterpiece, scary and satirical and surprising in all the best ways. I could get used to watching a new V/H/S every year. 
Oldboy 2003;10; This has been roaming around my watchlist forever, but after watching Decision to Leave, I finally decided to make this one a priority. Damn! What a chilling and tragic finale….and absolutely masterful. Truly an unforgettable ending. Lots to unpack and I’m sure that this has plenty of revelations in store upon rewatch. Highly recommend if you’ve not seen it.Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. Choi Min-Sik and Analeigh Tipton in Lucy2. Analeigh Tipton and Kevin Bacon in Crazy, Stupid, Love.  
It 1990;8;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃It may be a kinda cheesy made-for-TV adaption of Stephen King's It, but I would argue in terms of the overall story this is the better version."Kill It, Bev! ... Kill! ... Me? Oh you are priceless, brat! I am eternal, child. I am the eater of worlds, and of children. And you are next!"I would say the best film of the two versions would be 'It' from (2017), since it really nails the…  
Armageddon Time 2022;8;  There’s a lot about Armageddon Time that does work. It thrives on its strong performances, specifically Hopkins and Repeta, the heart and soul of the film. While I am Kendall Roy apologist, Jeremy Strong in this felt kind of goofy? Maybe it’s because it sounded like he was doing a really bad Ray Romano impression (or maybe a really good one?) but either way it was immensely distracting. But ultimately Gray’s unearthing of a tumultuous time and his attempt to grapple…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8;  Love Lives TodayMichael may have been onto something this whole time, Haddonfield fucking sucks. If there's one whole concept that I would think has been in these movies exclusively due to Danny McBride, who would find it really funny, it's that so many people in Haddonfield are total assholes. Everyone has something going on with them, not just trauma, but a feeling of outright hatred and instigation that can leap out. It's played well both for dramatic intent, as…  
Halloween II 2009;10; "so basically i just have to wait until my brain heals?" 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  There is a quote from Truffaut that has stayed with me since I first read it. And that's that, in his words, 'there's no such thing as an anti-war film,' as no matter how you handle it, depiction is allowing it to live on, allowing the voices of the perpetrators to continue being heard, for their gunshots to ring on forever. I remember dismissing it at first, and even now, I stand by that there are exceptions. Obayashi's anti-war trilogy…  
Black Adam 2022;8; A cocaine-laced Red Bull for the eyes. Some will call it a CGI schlockfest with thin characters, others will call it a good time. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4; this is like the movie version of that guy in your sociology class who keeps interrupting the professor to make some bland commentary about society using big pretentious flowery words that ultimately is just a bunch of nonsense that doesn’t really add into anything and then the professor just kinda goes silent for three seconds and then goes “ok, anyway” and then returns back to teaching the lecture 
Sleeping Beauty 1959;8; when i was younger i was terrified of maleficent, but like that’s mother right there. 
I Saw the Devil 2010;8; A sinister film about a psychopathic serial killer pursued and tortured by a police official. The hunter becomes the hunted, as justice becomes wrath. It taps into the lasting sentiment of Fincher's Seven but multiplies it across the entire film. Performances are superb and the extreme violence becomes a form of entertainment as you desensitise into the mindsets of the films two characters. Morality plays second fiddle to its blind and brutal savagery that are occasionally funny in the Tarantinian sense. 
Aftersun 2022;10; the pain of loving someone who is ultimately unknowable and taking what little fragments of themselves they left behind—everlasting moments that you may or may not have made up, images that seem trivial but carry the weight of the entire world, their words that stuck with you regardless of you knowing they were exaggerations, fairytales, things told simply to make you happy—to fill in the gaps haunting every corner of your memory when they are no longer with you… my head and heart hurt 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;6; Tatiana Maslany adds 2 stars to this rating.Painfully average with an amazing lead. The finale saved this from being rated lower. 
Smile 2022;8;  Fasten your seatbelts on this freight train of fear, because it’s going to take you to some truly terrifying and dark places.  A forced smile can be horrific to look at, awkward, uncomfortable, and unsettling.  That’s the general feeling Smile gives off as it takes you through it’s washed out hellish landscape.  Yes, it’s overly reminiscent of other horror films that have come before it, and I would usually knock it for doing that, but it’s done in such a…  
One Piece Film Red 2022;8;  One Piece Film: Red is the third and final film in Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three One Piece Colors Trilogy. An incandescent meditation on fate and chance, starring Monkey D. Luffy as a sweet-souled yet somber runway Pirate in the Grand Line whose life dramatically intersects with that of a bitter retired judge, played by Shanks. Red is an intimate look at forged connections and a splendid final statement from a remarkable filmmaker at the height of his powers. It may not…

No Country for Old Men 2007;8; the most disturbing shit about this movie is javier bardem's hairdo 
Evil Dead II 1987;8; evil dead II goes from normal to absolutely batshit crazy in like 6 minutes and then stays at that level for the whole runtime. what a fucking blast. 
Prisoners 2013;10; when hugh jackman sees jake gyllenhaal and whispers "fuck me"... relatable™ 
House 1977;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  You will believe a teenage girl can be eaten by a piano.  
Aftersun 2022;8;  As promising yet (mostly) fully developed a feature debut as I've seen in years, a film that threads the needle between depicting the unremarkable banality of the average memory while threading together its snatches of reflection into a work of narrative and emotional cohesiveness and flow. Even before you get to the last act, a mounting melancholy has set in that shapes everything as it goes along. And when it all does lead to a point, it comes not as…  
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;6; Rachel Sennott was the only one who understood the assignment. Make her the lead of the next Scream movie. 
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors 1987;10;  Horror sequels are not usually bastions of quality. It is an all-too-common occurrence to be treated to a spine-chilling original, only to be disappointed by the financially motivated and creatively redundant follow ups. However, it is also the case that later installments can build on the already established lore to deliver something both familiar and fresh with a playful approach towards tonality and style. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is many fans' favourite of the franchise for this…  
Eating Raoul 1982;8;  A black and absurd comedy that is at times unexpected and clearly falls into the genre of films that probably couldn't be made today. I mean, not even five minutes pass and you have a comedic situation in which a young black man attempting to rob a wine cellar or a market is gun down, with the owner showing no emotion or remorse. A scene that instantly establishes the tone for the rest of the film, where anything appears appropriate…  
The Good Nurse 2022;8;  Now I have a new fear 😂😂😂So my weak spot is always true story’s as they always fascinate me 100x more knowing it really happened. This movie did a great job of showing the crimes of Charlie Cullen without doing a Dahmer or Bundy and everyone loving them, they also did brilliant job of respecting the Victims by changing their names and Etc… Jessica Chastain carried the movie giving another incredible performance throughout like every movie she stars in…

The Good Nurse 2022;6; ► Watch my short review hereGood but forgettable, and the only thing that puts it slightly above average are the lead performances. While you won’t regret spending two hours on it, you’re going to wish you were watching a documentary about all of this instead. 
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial 1982;8; the movie magic fades a bit when you think about the intense missing persons case on ET’s home planet 
The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993;8;  “This is Halloween, This is Halloween” IS GOING TO BE STUCK IN MY HEAD ALL DAY!!!!Can’t believe after years and years of not watching this I finally got around to watching it and it was Fantastic .

Terrifier 2016;4; The kinda thing that weird kid at the back of the classroom with unwashed hair and a torn world industry tee would have worked on 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  london film festival #8a film that on paper you would think would be pretty mundane, as it seem to just be about a guy who's best mate randomly decides he wants nothing to do with him anymore, but it immediately pulls you in - initially with it's humour and then it starts to take you on a darker, sadder and heart-wrenching journey towards the end of a once cherished friendship. it also brilliantly delves into the pros and cons…  
The Last Unicorn 1982;8; A clock isn't time, it's just numbers and springs. Pay it no mind.Visually sublime and while it embodies some of the more classic tropes in fantasy, it was also ferociously ahead of its time thematically. Mommy Fortuna and the harpy are still terrifying. 
Dark Glasses 2022;8;  You have to adjust expectations: DARK GLASSES is akin to watching an 81-old man run a marathon at a decent clip. He used to be a master at it in his prime, but for the last twenty years, he'd faceplant a few steps in, shit his pants explosively, or run in the opposite direction while screaming obscenities. We all assumed he didn't have it in anymore - and that's fine. Time comes for us all.Yet somehow, Argento not only…  
Army of Darkness 1992;10; Top 20 I don't even care anymore. This film is just completely bonkers and makes just about no sense but who cares this is so much fun and so wild and so fun. This is basically just one massive slapstick comedy AND I LOVE IT so good ok goodbye.🔙 Paddington 2 ♻️🔜 5 Centimeters Per Second 
Catherine Called Birdy 2022;6; girl, i get it...... joe alwyn with long hair really does hit different 
Halloween Ends 2022;6;  Ciertamente es mejor que la entrega anterior, porque la historia se centra en los personajes principales y no solamente se centra en ser una película con escenas sangrientas, pero de igual forma comete algunos errores para ser la última película de la saga en general y de este nuevo reboot.Siendo cinsero sí disfruté la película como tal, pero constantemente estaba pensando de que esto no parecía ser el final de una saga que lleva años con nosotros, y que…  
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind 1984;8; I know this isn't Miyazaki's debut, and I think technically it's not Ghibli's debut either, but it is the first entry in my Ghibli Ranking, and it's one hell of a start.Studio Ghibli RankedAnimated Movies Ranked8.5/10 
Poltergeist 1982;4; A sterile studio attempt at horror to widen its pursestrings.All over the place with a ridiculous plot, silly science and embarrassingly special affect all set in a very Spielbergian American suburb. The opening copies Jaw, the rest is so reminiscent to his other work you must wonder what creative freedom Hooper even had.After taking bits and pieces from earlier horror it just descends into a fancy light show 
Stand by Me 1986;10; although i hadn’t seen him in more than ten years, i know i’ll miss him forever. the ending of this movie. 😫. i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again, movies from this time period about friendship always get me sobbing, it’s sick and twisted. i never had any friends later on like the ones i had when i was twelve. jesus, does anyone? :( 
TÁR 2022;8;  Now, before we begun let’s talk a bit about the filmmaker’s intent with this piece….What do you get when you cross Whiplash with Dangerous Liaisons and add a heaping helping of Caché’s atmosphere? Why, Tár, of course!Written and directed by Todd Field — who will always be Nick Nightingale from EYES WIDE SHUT to me — this is easily one of the most audacious films I’ve seen this year. And frankly, as fascinating as this movie is, it’s…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  When I moved from Florida to San Francisco in 2002, I wasn’t fleeing a codependent, toxic relationship, or a fraying, toxic friend circle, or a fractured, toxic family (ok, maybe fractured). I just felt like I was in a rut, and I loved Northern California, and I hated only seeing geriatric classic rock bands in concert. But as I started accomplishing things in San Francisco I hadn’t in Florida, I started to wonder. As memories of Florida became subsumed by…  
Pearl 2022;6;  Ti West’s second film outing this year, following the 70s horror throwback X, is an origin story of the killer herself Pearl. Driven by a sensational, gloriously unhinged performance by Mia Goth, Pearl is an amusing slasher film-character study with a heart. The display of craftsmanship is certainly the catch here. West’s Sirkian-inspired, heightened aesthetic evokes the overall attitude of the film. As for the story, West can’t avoid falling into tropes which is okay, but it’s far more substantial…  
Montana Story 2021;6; This family drama was overflowed with difficult emotions and regret. Stars Owen Teague as Cal and Haley Lu Richardson as Erin, two estranged siblings return home to their ailing father. Good performances with raw human emotion. It’s devastating to watch these two siblings interact. Erin’s level of stress was causing me to feel anxious. There were beautiful landscape shots and Ace to help break the tension. He was endearing. However, I did feel the length. It’s still a good watch.

Tusk 2014;6; he's got a podcast.. he deserved everything that happened to him 
See How They Run 2022;4; See How They Run did nothing for me. Bad cast of boring characters (not you Saoirse, obviously (you either Adrien Brody you big charming weirdo)). Sam Rockwell was bad as the inspector. Didn’t care that the director died. Didn’t care who killed him. Didn’t care when we found out. Not fun, not clever, didn’t let Saoirse spread her wings enough. Not funny. Whatever 2022 Ranked2022 Diary Ranked 
Licence to Kill 1989;8; The one where Bond pops a wheelie with a semi truck. You know the story, he wants revenge but his superiors tell him no way. So he goes for it anyway and everyone just kind of accepts it and lets it happen. And thank god for that, otherwise we wouldn’t get to see someone get pulled into a shredder and spray gallons of blood everywhere. 
Argentina, 1985 2022;10;  La primera lectura de la acusación que presenta Strassera contra los genocidas que operaron libremente durante la dictadura se realiza en un teatro. No me parece un detalle menor si tenemos en cuenta que sus cercanos le comentan la poca emotividad y fuerza que tiene, que es un discurso demasiado formal y correcto que aburrirá a las miles de personas que estarán presentes y escuchando por radio esa tan ansiada acusación. O "Strasserita" con la aclaración de que "el gesto…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;8; nothing like female empowerment after a lobotomy 
Aftersun 2022;10; God it hurts 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;6;  The cinema of emotional exhaustion and manipulation.The best cinematography in the world doesn't make this film a masterpiece. It's still quite decent in production but upon deeper reflection it leaves a lot to be desired. Extremely manipulative and shallow film that is shot and directed so incredibly that it almost masks the real agenda here. I kept wishing it would end.The music was horrendous and consistently stripped away any of the nuance that was possible here. Manipulative Is…  
I Know What You Did Last Summer 1997;8; what if i said hottest cast ever what then 
Little Shop of Horrors 1986;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Was Bill Murray’s small role as a masochist with a dentist kink necessary in this movie? No. Am I glad it was included? Yes.  
Emma. 2020;8; even in the rare occasion a period romance doesnt star keira they managed to squeeze the name 'knightley' in there 
Fight Club 1999;10; "they" could use that soap and take a fucking shower 
This Gun for Hire 1942;8;  "Try a cookie, they're very good."When ice cold assassin Philip Raven's (Alan Ladd) fat cat boss Willard Gates (Laird Cregar) decides to pay him in fake bills, he puts himself in the crosshairs of the killer's vengeance. Along the way Raven's path crosses with Ellen (Veronica Lake), a club worker similarly discontented with their mutual employer. Ellen decides to stick with Raven and try to see if it's possible to redeem him. Things are further complicated by the fact…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; i have never cried so fucking much. this movie is better than the first. powerful, moving, just amazing. 
Panic in the Streets 1950;8;  Richard Widmark is the public health official trying to prevent an outbreak of the pneumonic plague in Elia Kazan's noir tinged disaster movie. It gets off to a slow start - introducing the lead characters and setting the plot in motion via the killing of an illegal immigrant, who just happened to be infected. It's a real clock ticker as Kazan builds the tension by splitting the focus between the authority response and attempts by the criminals to escape capture.…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Like it’s equally excellent predecessor, Wakanda Forever thrives by being a film focused on itself and it’s characters. At every turn this bucks obnoxious quips and constant self-reference and commits to its drama. While not totally devoid of the MCU’s cgi problem, the world of this sequel felt noticeably more tactile and weighty. The action rips and improves on the first in just about every way. It’s near 3 hour length is excessive but I can’t say it bothered me. While I still have no faith in the MCU as a universe, I’m ever doubting Coogler again. 
Evil Dead Trap 2: Hideki 1992;8;  It’s always nice to see that in 1992 Japan there were still some filmmakers using cocaine like it was 1986 Hollywood!It’s been about 15 years since I saw this and I didn’t remember anything about it except some creepy kid. It vaguely started coming back to me while I watched it tonight. It’s a surrealist dream and a dream come true at that, but it’s a far cry from its predecessor.There are sone beautifully delirious scenes that are…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; beautiful, emotional tribute to chadwick boseman. and a hell of a save by ryan coogler & co - it’s not a perfect film (the talokan lore is a little messy and moves a lot more slowly than it needs to), but considering they’d already started filming when chadwick passed, this was an incredible late-game pivot and it’s a huge accomplishment that they pulled it off. letitia wright & angela bassett really gave such moving performances, and there are a couple moments dedicated to both chadwick and the concepts of grief and mourning that took my breath away. wakanda forever. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  for the longest time I’ve been saying how Michael B. Jordan will be in this solely cause he’s been in every other Ryan Coogler film (and you don’t want to break that streak) and people would laugh and say “zoe his characters dead that won’t happen” WELL WHOS LAUGHING NOW  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  From the first frame to the last, I was in a constant state of grief. A beautifully constructed tribute for the late Chadwick Boseman, and one that Coogler takes you through a journey of that grief and honors it into one of the MCU’s biggest sequels yet. A nearly 3-hour spectacle of blockbuster filmmaking, that can be a bit bloated at times, but is told through such passion that I can easily look past, purely on the story and characters.…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  There were plenty of sniffles to open and close this film and I appreciated the level of respect exhibited by acknowledging the real world grief that audiences will be coming into this film with.I was a big fan of the additional worlds created and explored, and while some may criticize the fact that most MCU films follow a very formulaic script, I was intrigued by the new antagonist, and his back story, as well.I also found this movie…  
Bluebeard 1944;8;  Edgar G. Ulmer's fascinating little B-movie, loosely based on the fairytale Bluebeard, stars John Carradine in the titular role. The film begins with panic - a murderer is loose on the streets of Paris and dead girls are turning up in the river. There's never any mystery as to the identity of the murderer - its clearly Carradine from the moment he is introduced. Apparently this was the actor's favourite of all his roles, and he gets a lot to…  
Interstellar 2014;8; Interstellar is a movie about the bond and love between a father and daughter disguised as a sci-fi movie. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10;  Of course, being a Weird Al movie through and through, don’t expect anything remotely based in reality to show up. The film spoofs all of the biopic standards, unsupportive family, the growth, the decline and the redemption (you know..). For someone whose life had hardly any scandals, the film invents many. As the screenwriting lecturer in Adaptation says, you can’t have a Hollywood script without a conflict. So the makers invent them to create a quintessential extravaganza.That is the…  
The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946;8;  Curated Cupcake Cinema #1Thanks for putting this together, cupcake!A film knotted together with deception and blistering passions, the characters rifle through motivations all for a bundle of dough—maybe the mysterious lover too. Tay Garnett’s film is a staple of postwar American cinema that cradles together the familiar and somewhat easygoing nature of melodrama with the fierce fatalism of the noir. Lana Turner is electric, holding up the less charismatic Garfield in the thick of it, though together they…  
Get Carter 1971;10; Hey ho - the new episode of Watch This List has just dropped, in which I wax loquacious about some of my favourite crime films - a doggedly nasty piece of business, guv, even if I do say so meself!!!Thanks to Amy Hensarling for listening to me gasbag for hours on end - she's performed a minor miracle in editing it down to acceptable length for your listening... I was going to say pleasure but... 
Pulp Fiction 1994;10;  Is there anything new to say about Pulp Fiction? Unlikely, but here are a few things I like about the film as well as some random observations.I like how it opens with two characters having a seemingly pointless conversation, the first of many, only for the same scene to appear at the end. The best thing about Pulp Fiction for me is the structure: how the story is told is separate fragments that overlap and wrap around each other.…  
Innocent Voices 2004;8; how to depict the evil, the horror, the endless tragedy? how to make the insufferableness bearable? how to do this without being hypocritical, looking like a cynical calculation to not alienate the audience, endangering the precious numbers?Voces Inocentes manages to handle this delicate situation very well. telling a story about the civil war in El Salvador during the 80s. looking through the eyes of the children, their naivity, their joyfulness, framing the horrific content in moderate language, creating a caring complexion instead of a simplistic fell good movie. 
Halloween 1978;10;  "It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare."Halloween by John Carpenter is by far the best of the series. Halloween, the original "economically" produced horror film started the Slasher movie craze, made Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) a star and held the record for highest grossing Independent Film for many years. It's become a staple on TV during Halloween season.Halloween night 1963, little Michael Myers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween…  
Fall 2022;10;  I’m really surprised this doesn’t have a higher overall rating because lemme tell you something: this movie tried to fucking kill me!Falling from a great height is literally my greatest fear. The thought of it can start a panic attack, I have nightmares about it, etc etc. When I was a kid I had a close call at Pilot Mountain in NC. I wandered off a trail and went too close to the edge of a cliff without seeing…  
The Vampire Doll 1970;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberA supernatural horror film with a seemingly mundane and limited plot that, like the film's secrets, conceals something far greater. In many ways, the film's simplicity is its greatest strength. Our vengeful spirit's design is simple but striking, notably its slightly original modus operandi.Even though the number of deaths is low, they will likely stay with you for quite some time, much like our ghostly killer. The actors are particularly good,…  
Nine Inch Nails: Beside You In Time 2007;10;  In spite of what may seem like a fairly simplistic visual presentation, it is all effective. At other moments, the screen may jumble as we watch a variety of movies with varying degrees of surrealism that fit the themes of the songs and serve to emphasize those themes.At the end of the day, though, like with each Nine Inch Nails concert, what counts most is the stage presence of everyone involved, and in this part, everyone does a terrific…  
Triangle of Sadness 2022;10; The Karl Marx Brothers in Monkey Business 2!I laughed a lot — and the Third Act is awesome. Lots of great moments sprinkled in before that as well. Anyone hating on this, is literally just a hater and hates movies. The world is so hostile to real satire in the realm of entertainment (which this is) that even a “Water is wet” style critique is welcome in my book. And this def goes more in depth than that! Watch it with an audience and have a fun evening. Nice update/upgrade of Swept Away imo. Highly recommended for fans of Survivor and Mark Fisher LoL 
In Search of the Last Action Heroes 2019;6;  Another good entry in the "In Search..." series, this time examining the action subgenre, while the 1980s receive the bulk of the attention, earlier and later decades are not ignored, especially given the influence of martial arts films and the rise of the genre. The story goes that action movies didn't become a proper genre until the 1980s.The films featured are mostly the more commercially successful ones, but I've learned much of their history from other documentaries like "Canon"…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Did about everything I’d want from a Halloween sequel. Made some bold and very interesting choices and wasn’t as heavy handed with its themes as it’s predecessor.If this is truly Jamie Lee’s final time back in a Halloween film then I’m incredibly satisfied with this finale and where it leaves her role in the series.Though, I’m of course rooting for H60 in 2038. 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8;  The reasons why this is enjoyable are almost exclusively surface level, and that’s perfectly okay! For instance, does the film actually say anything about Gen Z aside from “the language can be annoying?” No, but watching Rachel Sennott frantically babble on about allyship and lace the words “upper middle class” with the utmost venom is worth the price of admission. Does the film successfully get you invested in these characters’ backstories and emotional stakes, particularly the main “love” triangle? Not…  
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie 2019;10; game of thrones' ending was so bad, breaking bad had to show 'em how to do it properly a second time... bitch 
Men 2022;4; OMG I just discovered from the movie called Men that men are bad! Did anyone else know that?! Bravo Alex Garland! 
The Outside 2022;6; I immediately ordered 67 tubes of this lotion for myself. World of the beautiful and successful here I come! 
Pickman's Model 2022;6; Wow! If I had a nickel for every time I've seen Ben Barnes play an old timey man haunted by a horrifying painting, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice right? 
Barbarian 2022;8;  HOLY SHIT! This gave me the vibe of Resident Evil games! I terrified!Barbarian has lots of chilling moments. And this is so hard for today' horror films. The story is like 10 Cloverfield Lane meets REC but it's not that simple. I felt Resident Evil' bonechilling vibe. Amazing camerawork from start to finish. A perfect use of sound and music to make a create strong atmosphere. Great performances, bold story decisions specially final act is absolutely original and shocking.…  
The Shining 1980;10; Elevated Horror doesn’t exist, but The A24 Blueprint most assuredly does. 
Curse of Chucky 2013;6;  mancini tries to reroute away from the postmodern wackiness of his previous entries and back towards the simple commercial slasher origins of the child's play films while still incorporating the gleefully, graphically violent antics and bizarre lore he's built for himself over 6 movies now. not all of it works but i was impressed at how much effort is put into making all these movies fit together narratively (though the inclusion of what feels like 4 post-credits stingers gets a…  
Pearl 2022;10; mia goth is a STAR 
Reservoir Dogs 1992;10; I feel like I know every frame of this film, every line, every song, every edit, every inch of that warehouse and I still always find a little moment or detail that surprises me, even at 3am. 
The Red Shoes 1948;10; I've seen too many movies to know for sure, and I'm sure such a proclamation is foolish considering we're talking about art, but this is still probably my pick for the best film ever made. 
20th Century Girl 2022;10; this film was so cute and then all of a sudden got so sad AND FOR WHAT 😐 
The Keep 1983;8; The Keep actually makes so much sense it’s crazy. 
Stoker 2013;6; I had never actually seen Park Chan-Wook's first English language film, something I thought I should rectify ahead of Decision to Leave. While Stoker is a relatively staid and elegant affair for the dynamic Korean filmmaker, there is no lack of visual and editorial flourishes, supported by a healthy dose of psychological provocation and suspense. It’s disappointing that this flare doesn't sum up to anything more than a shallow, and slightly tedious, experience. Not my favourite of his but certainly a worthwhile viewing. 
I Saw the Devil 2010;10; Ultimate Revenge !!!!I saw the devil is one of the most horrifying and gruesomest stories I’ve seen recently and I absolutely loved it, from beginning to end it was a edge of your seat experience. Some scenes are super disturbing and creepy which was very entertaining for this movie and throughout you can’t wait for Lee Byung-hun’s character to attack and return for Kyung-Chul charcter as you enjoy the scenes of torture even if it’s between your fingers😂  This is definitely 100% a must watch especially in the month of October and this isn’t talked about enough. 👏👏🚙🛞🔧👂🩸💦🤜🤛🤕🔪🩸🎥🎥 
X 2022;6;  There is a scene in this film in which a character swimming in a lake is silently chased by an alligator. The ethereal beauty of the sequence serves as a poignant metaphor for the central thrust of the film, an unknown danger, hiding away. Stalking the central characters without their knowledge. But later in the film it turns out that this sequence was actually just a piece of foreshadowing, building up to a convenient and cheap death scene. And that…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6; Fuck it, I'll knock it up to a 3. It's grown in my mind a bit.It's just the concept and direction is a solid 4 but the execution is like a 2.Also the script is so rushed with forced arcs and random plot-desperate motivations, but besides Carpenter, I do think Green is the best director in his approach to this franchise. The way the cold open is cut/edited is so sharp. He also gives Haddonfield a life that many of the sequels fail at, as their movies could be set in Randomville, USA.But it's also as stupid as it is smart 
Stars at Noon 2022;6; very sad to admit that i did not love a claire denis movie starring margaret qualley and benny safdie 
The Exorcist 1973;10; I’m not proud of this but that poor girl would be on her own if she barfed Nickelodeon slime in my face. 
Scream 2022;8;  Solid movie, I had no faith in it to be honest, I just watched this one because I was curious about how a new director and also a new cast would handle a new part of the franchise. It left a good taste in my mouth, after all.It seems to be the fifth movie, I thought it was some kind of new remake then I watched it, but I had only watched the first one of the franchise before.…

The Lighthouse 2019;8; Robert Eggers drenched in sweat running to his desk, scratching down quickly in his notebook only this: mussy (mermaid pussy) 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;8; tim curry really is a whole other level of human being 
Practical Magic 1998;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I like how they had to kill this asshole twice and he STILL didn't leave them alone. That's men for you.  
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;10;  "You'd probably like it if you didn't know what was in it."Horror is derived, ultimately, from the unknown. Your fears are rooted in a fear of death, even when they are irrational phobias, ultimately, the core of fear is that something will somehow harm you. Harm leads to death, which leads to the unknown--fear is possible because in the depths of our minds, we're all agnostics. I've acknowledged my agnosticism for a long time now, but even after over…  
BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths 2022;2;  “Autofiction” is the death of us all—culturally speaking, socially speaking. The incurably narcissistic Iñárritu, like Octavio Paz before him, thinks he’s God’s gift to Mexico. At least Paz could write well. And at least history, to Paz, was never the simple-minded Fellini-pilled jokey fantasy Iñárritu makes it out to be here. Leave it to AGI to not only insert himself into Mexican history as if he were touched with the spirit of Lenin or Allende (or Eisenstein or Guzmán), but…  
Causeway 2022;6; The script relies on contrived melodrama anytime it runs out of ideas, but the two central performances are so deeply and believably human that the film almost works in spite of itself. I’ll slap anyone who tells me the prison scene was written before CODA won Best Picture. 
Bullet Train 2022;8; This Dora character pisses me off 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  “Well, there goes that dream.”Feckin’ incredible. I’ve been a fan of McDonagh since In Bruges. So consistent over the years, and I think this might be his best work yet. Not only is it his best looking film, but the writing is perfection. I laughed, I gasped, I teared up. What starts off as a tale about cynicism and nihilism ends up being more of a cautionary warning to letting those things take over you. Colin Farrell’s character, Pádraic,…  
Last Night in Soho 2021;6;  Geoff T's Hoop-Tober 9.0 ChallengeLast Night in Soho (2021)So obviously I’ve been very fond of Edgar Wright’s work for a long time, from the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy and Baby Driver. As such, I was naturally drawn to his latest film, a swinging 60s-based psychological horror-thriller that feels like his tribute to Argento (and the giallo genre in general) of sorts.Ellie Turner is an aspiring fashion designer who has a love for all things 1960s. Raised by…  
Hocus Pocus 2 2022;8; is no one gonna talk about how mayor traske called the sandseron sisters “gothic golden girls” 💀

House 1977;10;  House. 1977. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi.House is perhaps one of the most original Japanese films we have seen that rank high in our Asian Cinema List & Japanese Films (eg The Ballad of Narayama, After Life, and Tampopo). House’s screenplay by Chiho Katsura and Chigumi Obayashi (his daughter irl wrote the original story) is incredibly creative, thrilling, and entertaining. In turn, the female crew of seven girls that visit the home of Gorgeous aunt. House can be viewed as a vampire film, a…  
Hellraiser 1987;8;  “Come to daddy.”So today I decided to watch another all time classic for this Halloween month.It’s my first time watching something from this franchise and I had no idea that there were 9 more movies!This flick is written and directed by Clive Barker, it’s based on his own novel, which one was called The Hellbound Heart.It’s about a mysterious demoniac box that follows the rules of the famous expression: “Curiosity killed the cat”.As we all know…  
Black Adam 2022;10; Lmao u can Imagine how Flabbergasted I was when I saw the rating. Dudee I thought we all thinking this was good. Apparently there is no we😭I do saw some cringe scene like every time the camera shot the kid, I'm sorry that kid can't deliver the line smoothly and it was started badly for like some minutes until Justice Society came. But the fight on slow motion was really hyped me up, Dr. Fate and Black Adam really got my attention, I think I can believe on DC rn. Anw I need to know about Dr. Fate more, please. 
Agnes of God 1985;8;  Another excellent recommendation from the Letterboxd gang. This time in a film with a fairly cliched and tiresome approach to the Catholic Church, notably the nun conventions and their tight restrictions, and how this can presumably lead to a lot of problematic actions. At the same time, it exploits this for the endless discussion between the value or irrelevance of the church in contemporary times, from a place that, as I noted earlier, feels a bit shallow where it doesn't…  
Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Chris Chibnall saw the hit 2022 film Bullet Train and thought to himself "I can do that", then preceded to do so with less than 5 times the budget or writing skill. So much so that the titular train was lost just as quickly as it was introduced with a blur and horrid direction, so nothing has changed since 2018 then…Seriously though, as cool as it was to see the Classic Doctors back onscreen again after all these years…   
The Driller Killer 1979;6;  #SlasherSaturdayThis was like if Three’s Company replaced Jack Tripper with Travis Bickle……and then he proceeded to kill a bunch of bums with a power drill. A grimy and squalid depiction of a Bohemian existence, Reno is a starving artist just trying to make rent when an infomercial and $19.95 unlocks a new ability and unleashes an “outlet” for his rage. This film has a scuzzy aesthetic, a discordant  music/sound design and an even nastier outlook. Not necessarily the most enjoyable…  
Causeway 2022;6; Beautiful film in a lot of ways but this kind of stripped back, minimalist joint really needs a powerful performance to carry it, and Jennifer Lawrence just can't quite compensate for the lack of narrative momentum. Bryan Tyree-Henry kinda steal the show and you're left wanting a little more. 
It's a Wonderful Life 1946;10; I was expecting a nice Christmas movie. What I got was a f*cking masterpiece.It's a Wonderful Life is easily one of my favorite Christmas movies. It's just beautiful. The direction is wonderful, the story is wonderful, the ending is wonderful and the performances are absolutely wonderful, especially James Stewart who I saw for the first time today and he convinced me so much that I want to see more movies with him immediately!I can't believe that this movie still holds up so well and looks so good after more than 70 years. A classic that really deserves to be called a classic. 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10;  🎬 Check out my 2022 movie rankings here!MY MIND AND ME WE DON’T GET ALONG SOMETIMES AND IT GETS HARD TO BREATHE BUT I WOULDN’T CHANGE MY LIFESelena Gomez was one of my first impressions of a “celebrity” growing up. Seeing her on Disney Channel and consequently listening to her music as I grew up had such a positive impact on my life. She’s always been one of the biggest role models in my life and I couldn’t…  
Targets 1968;8;  Quite simply a detached and direct reminder as to why the general public should not own firearms. It doesn't get more counter culture than this.We never understand what drives Bobby Thompson into his killing spree that starts with the killing of his mother. The lack of meaning to the killings will frustrate some but its essential to its point. It would only allow those who are angry with the film an opportunity to attack it. It is an important…  
See How They Run 2022;8; my girl saoirse ronan is back 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10;  Look fella, if your brain doesn’t pop out of your head to do cartwheels at the sight of Conan as Warhol sidling up to Emo Philips as Salvador Dali at a rockin’ Dr. Demento pool party, well then, quite frankly, I sincerely hope you one day find happiness in some other way…but just make sure it’s out in the woods somewhere, where you can’t bother me.Extremely EXTREMELY grateful I got to see this in a packed theater with laughs…  
Terminator Salvation 2009;6; Only do something special with your character when you can commit to it. What's the point of making the hero a Terminator if it has no other effects than physical?This is Christian Bale's fiercest performance yet, though. And I don't mean the movie but the leaked set recording. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8;  Based on the 1928 novel of the same name, a novel that has already been adapted into film twice in 1930 and 1979, All Quiet on the Western Front follows the harsh realities of fighting on the front lines of World War I, as German solider Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer) has his life turned upside when he realises war is not about becoming a patriotic hero. The power of the original 1928 novel and its other film adaptions is the…

Frankenhooker 1990;8; Of Henenlotter’s many cinematic contributions, perhaps the most invaluable is his unintentional chronicling of New York City in the ‘80s. The sights, the sounds, and the palpable grime feel so authentic anytime his films step outside. As for this one, Jeffrey Franken isn’t as immediately involving as the tortured protagonists of Basket Case and Brain Damage—truthfully, you’re ready for him to get taken down a peg or two even before he begins preying on sex workers—but the titular creation absolutely delivers, and the subsequent Shelley/Lovecraft-infused anarchy is both totally bonkers and thrillingly empowering. Before there was Ex Machina, there was Frankenhooker. 
Black Panther 2018;10; Gearing up for Wakanda Forever. For my money this remains the strongest solo hero movie by Marvel.Amazing action scenes and character development. The story has so much heart. Improves on every viewing. 
Monica, O My Darling 2022;8;  Monica, O My Darling is a very Andhadhun-esque whodunit thriller that’s sharply written with interesting characters. While it doesn’t achieve the high of Andhadhun, it is quite self-aware and the plot twists left me surprised and actually made sense. The watching experience is further elevated by the great editing and the way music is integrated into the story. Rajkummar Rao takes the center stage and he does his usual best, but Huma Qureshi stood out here as she was probably…  
Bros 2022;2;  There's something kind of sublimely terrible in watching a film this eager - damn near hostile, really - to proclaim itself a triumph for communal progress function so nakedly as an act of narcissistic, individualistic self-regard for its writer-star. The whole thing is pitched in an ongoing, deeply tiresome register of "I'm going to say something mean about myself first, so it seems like I'm being self-loathing, but really it's so I can immediately criticise everybody else for being worse…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;8;  An overstuffed but fun, sweet and imaginative PG animated horror. There's A LOT going on in this film, perhaps too much for a film running under 2 hours. Netflix could've easily turn this into a tv show but thank God they didn't. The production design and animation in this are incredible as expected, with characters that have certain elements that make them truly unique. The amount of creativity that fills each frame is truly admirable, although it ends up making…  
Witness for the Prosecution 1957;10;  Witness for the Prosecution. 1957. Directed by Billy Wilder.When one of London’s greatest plays meets a superb United States director for a neo-noir, courtroom procedural, whodunnit, the best courtroom drama since Anatomy of a Muder (1959) takes place. Billy Wilder’s multi-talented direction of Witness for the Prosecution (1957) is flawless and is a courtroom procedural that was a widely popular London play by Agatha Christie. Wilder adds his creative special touch like the fairy’s wand on this material. Courtroom procedurals…  
Barbarian 2022;8;  You could smash my head against the wall a thousand times before I even consider drinking from that bottle. Barbarian is a solid entry to the contained survival horror genre. What starts out slow and mysterious gives way to some really shocking reveals and great suspenseful moments. And all of this from one of “the whitest kids u know?”The real strength is in the framing of the narrative. By starting with one character’s descent into the truth of what…  
Trick or Treat 1952;6; a cute seasonal classic in which donald gets owned by a witch for trying to ruin halloween and just generally being a dickhead uncle. some of the old-school disney shorts might have some messaging that hasn't aged well but i think "don't fuck with the best holiday" holds up. 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;8; they just don’t make insanely horny movies with no plot like this anymore 💔 
American Psycho 2000;10; i don't think i could fix him but i could fuck him and that's enough for me 
Barbarian 2022;8;  There are three kinds of men in this. 1. Guy who doesn't fucking listen. 2. Horrible Narcissist guy. And 3. Evil sociopath guy. Which does, in fact, cover the full range of personalities the gender has to offer. This absolutely benefits from the minimal poster art and obtuse title. I don't watch movie trailers - I hate how they manage to take much of the discovery process away from me - so having no idea what I was getting into,…  
Scream 3 2000;6; Minus one whole star for reminding me Creed existed. 
Wishmaster 1997;8; Today's viewing of Wishmaster was my first actually and I thought it was pretty damn great. The movie has a solid set-up, Andrew Divoff plays the creepy Djinn superbly, we get God tier level practical effects on behalf of KNB, there are loads of awesome cameos, plus the movie gives off all the '90s vibes. In other words, it has a lot going for it.I had a blast watching this with Michelle. 
Freaky Friday 2003;8; Society peaked during this era 
[REC] 2007;10; Felicitaciones a °[REC] por ser de las únicas found footage que sabe usar su concepto de forma realista lo más aterrador y estresante posible.Superó demasiado mis expectativas y vaya que se acercó mucho a provocarme miedo por cómo le devuelve el temor a los zombies con actuaciones tan naturales, sobre todo la de Manuela Velasco. Ahora ya me da más miedo vivir en edificio 😩 y tardé en entender porque se llama REC, dato 
Pearl 2022;8;  Pearl's mid-movie monologue meanders magnificently, melding menacingly murderous moments with a raw ambition that cannot be tamed, and as she releases an outpouring of her innermost feelings, a maggot infested suckling pig sits carelessly on the porch taking in the sunshine and putrefying the air around this stunning, rancid farmland vista."All I ever really wanted was to be loved"Mia Goth has come of age here in Pearl with a performance that ascends her to sit alongside Samara Weaving…  
Midnight in Paris 2011;8; idk but i would looove to walk around paris with owen wilson 
Minamata 2020;8;  An incredible true story film that regrettably did not receive the exposure it deserved due to a number of factors, including COVID-19, the Johnny Depp and Heard legal dispute, and maybe not receiving all of the promotion due to a lack of resources from the distributor.A story that, in many ways, is reminiscent of Todd Haynes' Dark Water, but this time the case is set in 1970s Japan and told thru the lens of a LIFE magazine photographer played…  
Get Out 2017;6;  Horroroktober die Elfte (11/3) feat. DuBFal-Horrorweeks - 2nd Round - Film Nr. 11Welch Beben erlebte die Filmlandschaft 2017 mit „Get Out“. Tosend wie die Brandung der Bering See und grollend wie ein Felssturz im Grand Canyon unseres viel näheren, aus dem Berge gesprengte Schneedecke brodelnd niederstürzend wie ein Tsunami einer Lawine erschien das Horrorgenre neu rehabilitierende das erste Filmregiewerk des Komikers und Schauspielers Jordan Peele. In Scharren zu hunderten und tausenden strömte das kinoaffine Publikum in die Kinos und…  
TÁR 2022;10;  architect of your soul. embodies and flawlessly captures the very specific, discomforting, clean, quiet, anxious energies that permeate inside of a nearly empty concert hall, wherein every footstep echoes to infinity and every page turn feels like a gunshot. having spent multiple years in an out of orchestras i’ve never seen a film that better captures what that world is like, how playing and performing is triumphant vs how anxious and depressing it is to always be playing to large…  
Bros 2022;8;  Sup bro, just watching Some movie Bro.This movie was actually hilarious, I found myself laughing out loud so many times especially the scenes where they grouped up for the LGBTQ+ museum and when Jim Rash kept saying about Bisexuals. I felt like Billy Eichner put slot of him self in this movie and felt almost like how life would be for him or someone like him being gay in New York, as a straight male I did still very…  
TÁR 2022;10;  For several years, director Todd Field considered just writing this idea into a novella. Like his mentor, Stanley Kubrick, who put himself into exile by moving as far away from the clamours of the studios as possible, Field left behind narrative cinema after his bleak depiction of marriage in Little Children. Despite having garnered eight Academy Award nominations with only two films, Field wouldn't attach himself to just any project. He became particular. Here's a great article outlining the dozens…  
Decision to Leave 2022;10; The wise love the water, the benevolence the mountains. I am not benevolent. I like the sea.There is something special about the way Park Chan-Wook creates the atmosphere in his films. Nonetheless, wonderful!Didn't even realise at first that the Techno Queen (i.e. Lee Jung-Hyun) was part of the film. 
The Nice Guys 2016;8;  a perfect illustration of shane black's strengths and weaknesses, everything that's an expression of his dirtbag-sleuth protagonists is slick, well-drawn, hilarious, and every-thing and every-one outside of those protagonists is too broad, too milquetoast, too cartoonish and dependent on sentimental schtick. the tony scotts and richard donners of the world can take all that and push it into various extremes, but shane black himself kinda sits in his own neo-noir pool hall and plays the obligatory billiards because he's real…  
Act of Betrayal 1988;6;  Action! - The Ghostly, Thrilling and Often Comedic Tales of Lawrence Gordon ClarkLawrence Gordon Clark goes back to Ireland while the country is still reeling from the havoc wreaked by The Troubles. This time, he brings with him a seasoned actor in the form of Elliott Gould, who plays a former IRA member who turns into an informant and must now do his job despite the rigors of life and a hitman on his tail. On top of all…  
The Superdeep 2020;4;  Hooptober 9: It’s in Space Now Well, at least the effects were cool.What do you want me to say about this? It’s an incredibly derivative film that never really finds its identity. Not to mention that runtime. Jesus did it really need to be almost two hours long? With how damn bad the pacing is and how sluggish it all feels, what cool shit we do get feels few and far between. Seriously they could’ve trimmed so much shit…  
Blade Runner 1982;8; ridley scott: im gonna nap since the the visuals and sound design of my movie are taken care of, wake me up in 5 so i can work on the plot[5 mins later]me: ridley! wake upridley: zzzzme: ridley ! the plot ! 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  waited for this to drop on streaming cuz I wasn’t about to pay for publicity drama. i miss september, time flies manI’ll start by saying if you like this good for you. if not i get where your coming from. don’t wanna be redundant and mention the jordan peele influence, i.e: get out and us. stepford wives and truman show. white mirror lmao. personally i blew threw the first half and didn’t feel shit. wasn’t till the shock therapy…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  This was a feckin hard watch. Banshees of Inishirin introduces audiences to the small island off the coast of Ireland where the story takes place in its first scene, showing the ships coming in to port, bustling with energy and determination. Even a rainbow glistens beyond the shot over the water, it’s picturesque and cheerful. Director, Martin McDonagh then drops the audience on their collective ass, spits on them and laughs because what an insanely depressing depiction of loneliness this…  
Entergalactic 2022;8; if kid cudi has 5,000,000 fans i’m 1 of themif kid cudi has 500,000 fans i’m 1 of themif kid cudi has 5000 fans i’m 1 of themif kid cudi has 500 fans i’m 1 of themif kid cudi has 1 fan that’s meif kid cudi has 0 fans that means i died 
The Bad Guys 2022;8; the furrification of ocean’s eleven (2001)  
Halloween Kills 2021;6; has no one in this series heard of a fucking rocket launcher 
Legally Blonde 2001;10; elle woods was at harvard at the same time as mark zuckerberg 
Whiplash 2014;10; this is definitely my fucking tempo holy shit 
Anna Karenina 2012;8; men, what’s stopping u from looking like aaron taylor-johnson? 
The Craft 1996;8; if the bitches of eastwick put a spell on me, do not prosecute them they caught ME slipping that’s on ME 
Nightcrawler 2014;8; in loving memory of jake gyllenhaal... he ain’t dead but the academy keep treating him like he is 
Scooby-Doo 2002;8; scrappy doo is a punk ass bitch 
Nightcrawler 2014;10; Lou Bloom probably owns a Normal People Scare Me t-shirt 
Ex Machina 2014;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This is a movie about the ways that men treat women. The "Obvious Misogynist" considers women as a tool for him to control and fuck at his leisure. The "Nice Guy" wants to be a friend and liberator to women, but that interest comes and goes proportional to how much he wants to have sex with them. No matter how similar in intellect and skill we prove ourselves to be, they believe it is up to them to determine our worth, our freedom, even our personhood. Fuck them. Rock on, Ava.  
Cujo 1983;8;  Horroroktober die Zweiundzwanzigste (22/3) feat. DuBFal-Horrorweeks - 2nd Round - Film Nr. 22In dem 2000 erschienen Buch von Stephen King Das Leben und das Schreiben, in dem King über eben seine ersten Schritte vom kleinen Hosenscheißer bis zum Verfasser erster, kindlicher Gruselgeschichten bis zu dem heuten King of Horror erzählt, wie uns sein komprimiertes Wissen um das Schreiben bzw. den Werkkasten Schreiben darlegt, schildert er in einem kurzen Abriss eine Geschichte um einen eine Frau stalkenden Mann und dessen…  
The Mist 2007;8;  Stone cold modern classic. One of my top 5 King stories (which I thought could never be topped by the amazing surround sound performance audiobook from the 90’s) directed by one of my favorite filmmakers and it’s still as gripping, scary and dreadful as I remember seeing it in an empty theater 15 years ago. One of its secret weapons is the use of “verite” filmmaking (hand held, dirty zooms & focus, a lack of music until the end, etc) and…  
Ghostbusters: Afterlife 2021;6; Maybe it's because I watched this on a plane gone off like 40mg of edibles, but honestly, I thought this was fun and enjoyable. Would have loved it if I had seen as a kid.UPDATE: Olivia Wilde as Gozer got me feelin a certain way ha ha 😜 
The Cursed 2021;6;  When this movie first came out on Sundance, many people complimented it for introducing something fresh to the werewolf genre, and by the third act, that's more than clear. The make-up and practical effects of whatever that creature or beast was were grotesquely awesome.Technically, the cinematography is amazing. The photography and production design contribute significantly to the sense of dread and despair. The lore is an interesting mix of the familiar and subtle fresh tweaks to the werewolf curse…  
Martin 1976;6;  Well, Jacob was right, this is something else. I haven't seen all of Romero's films, but based on what I've seen, it wouldn't be a stretch to call this one the nastiest. It's a film that leans more toward the experimental, with an approach that will likely not resonate with a wide audience. It's unusual. It's a lot like being trapped in a bind from which you can't break free. John Amplas does a fantastic job of capturing this man's…  
The Watcher 2022;6; Red HerringsWhile entertaining throughout for the most part, at the conclusion I can’t really say that it feels like a worthwhile watch. Naomi Watts always earns a 😍 from me, but I don’t really think I would recommend this to anyone. This is all red herrings, many with several logical loopholes and and an ending without a resolution. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 11. Margo Martindale and Kevin Bacon in Rails & Ties 
Black Adam 2022;4; It really is sad that the queen will never get to see this movie

Don't Worry Darling 2022;2; olivia wilde wants to be jordan peele so bad 
A Clockwork Orange 1971;2;  look hopefully by now, y'all know me and know that when i don't enjoy a movie, that doesn't mean that i don't see the merit of it or that i want to attack its fans. art is subjective and art like this has been a staple for as long as it has because it's so open to interpretation.okay- so i'm sorry but i thought this was just morally nasty and nihilistic to the point that i couldn't get any…  
Taxi Driver 1976;10;  I find it strange that this movie is so popular. I see 'bros' quoting it and they always have this next to Goodfellas and The Sopranos and Entourage in their collection of movies(as do I). I think a lot of people like it for the wrong reasons. They like the violence and the guns and DENIRO. But for me this is the quintessential art house film: ambiguous in it's meaning, a meandering story with no plot in sight, a protagonist…  
Entergalactic 2022;10; I love romcoms and I love animation, so I really loved this movie. 
Barbarian 2022;8; I was thinking no one is stupid enough to not realize they have an entire tunnel system in their basement but then we met AJ and it all made sense. 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;6; Enola Holmes 2: Too Silly, Too PredictableClick here to see my review on Tik Tok: bit.ly/3EBqanv 
Far from Heaven 2002;4; a classic cannibalization of the genre, but not sure if having this clean, moral compass through all those issues we agree on is much of a subversive move anymore (if not to the contrary even?).anyway, guess you watch this for the heavy amounts of pretty autumn leaves cheekily hiding all those "dirty secrets", and cute polychromatic opulence luxuriating in itself. looks like on some days Haynes went into autopilot and Ed Lachman just took over. 
Chaos Walking 2021;6; Chaos indeed.Chaos Walking is a sci-fiction romance drama adapted from a YA novel. A-listers Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley and Mads Mikkelsen brought their A-game, but this Doug Liman work is boring, repetitive and lacks grit to truly connect. The storytelling is just a dull retread of things we've seen again and again from other teen-targeting ficfion. The characterization is ghastly too - Holland's Todd Hewitt has zero development and it was Ridley's Viola who finished off the main baddies. Chaos Walking scratched surface with the pro-feminism twist, but at that point this movie is already beyond salvageable. 
Deathdream 1974;6; Frankenstein for the Vietnam generation.Jumps between the ghoulish and the tragic without settling or establishing either. It’s also catatonically slow through the middle. 
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 1993;10;  I hear Kevin Conroy's voice almost every day. Sometimes through my TV as I return to the most formative television of my childhood, the series that sparked a lifelong obsession with animation and superheroes. But much more often, I hear his rumbling gravel in my head. In my bones. I've been reading Batman comics regularly for as long as I could read. He's a character I encounter at least once a week, usually more, and every time - every time…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  The king is gone. And with him went so much more. It is neither developed enough narratively nor complex enough politically. A step down from its predecessor (MCU’s need for a shared universe practically undermines it at every turn.), but better than the recent slate of MCU blockbusters. Where the first film balanced a lean story with a focus on thematic and emotional integrity, 'Wakanda Forever' throws this balance off with a bloated narrative weighed down with too many plot…  
Perfect Blue 1997;10; I have an anxiety attack when I listen to the score but wow do I love it. 
Brokeback Mountain 2005;10; cried so hard like a lil bitch baby piss boy, that i shit myself 😻 
The Bad Guys 2022;8; Diane is literally a female version of Nick Wilde 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is not as rewatchable as the first movie, but has a better all-around story that is emotional, impactful, and engaging.A wonderful tribute to Chadwick Boseman. 
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;8; It began as this year’s CATS — in a good way — and ended as THE GREEN MILE, which somehow wasn’t a bad thing. None of the creative choices should have worked, but with whimsical, charming songs and lively stop-motion, they manages to land. And while it’s a big swing, isn’t that the only swing worth taking with material that’s already been done to death? 
Night of the Werewolf 1981;8; This is way better than I thought it would be, the werewolf makeup looks great, and it's dripping with atmosphere.As always Paul Nashchy fills this movie with stunningly beautiful women.There is even an epic fight between the werewolf and a vampire woman, good stuff. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10; Even if it wasn't a great movie (which it absolutely is), it would still be at least one of the best looking films of the year. This movie is STUNNING to look at. I don't know if I like this more than the 1930 one or not, since they're very different and it would be unfair to comapare them. They're both great. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Gozer, "Are you a God?" Martin McDonagh, "Feck, yes I am." McDonagh has crafted one of his more poignant texts into a devastatingly comical elegiac Irish tale of a bond gone wrong, the humor is jet-black, as anticipated. Seeing Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson onscreen together again caused me unadulterated bliss. Their chemistry as artists is extraordinary. And as remarkable as Gleeson is here, Farrell equals him with what may perhaps be the finest acting he has ever managed. Carter…   
The Lost City 2022;6; 2022 Ranked Fun film. Fun Daniel Radcliffe. Fun fun fun. 
Bonnie and Clyde 1967;10; Violence as film myth. It remains a terrific update of Scarface anarchy to drive in era. The Hawks movie is a better analogue than the usual couples on the lam movies it gets compared to because of the way they constant let noble savagery turn into ugly comedy. Beatty and Dunaway are remarkably good and Benton/Newman script gives Penn plenty of opportunity to amplify its slapdash style. In some ways, it feels like a conscious attempt of blowing up the suffocate constraints of The Chase, two very different visions of apocalypse from inside and outside society, the violent gutter ending remains the same. 
Dreams in the Witch House 2022;6;   Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities - 6/8 Ron will never hear the end of this. Not many rational minds could have expected a sequel to two beloved classics in one. It would be up to none other than del Toro to continue the Weasley and Ratatouille sagas in one.Nothing is as you would think. There was little excitement for this entry. Perhaps the least of them all. On the one hand you have Rupert Grint in a Lovecraft…  
Kramer vs. Kramer 1979;10; Kinda set the blueprint for everything 
Summer of Sam 1999;8;  Es herrscht Aufruhr in den Straßen New York City. Ein seine Morde zur Serie ausbauender Serienmörder, von den Medien 44 Kaliber Killer, später durch seine Briefe an den ermittelnden Polizeidetektiv besagten Falles Captain Joseph Borrelli wie sich selbstbezeichnend Son of Sam getauft, terrorisiert die Millionenmetropole verschlossener Türen, leerer Abend- und Nachtstraßen und durchgedrückter Gaspedale nur schnell in der Sicherheit der eigenen vier Wänden. Gefangen von dieser Hysterie einer laufenden Dynamitstange, erlebt die Jungend der Bronx ihre ganz eigenen kleinen Dramen…

My Policeman 2022;4; a movie as beautiful as the book? no. let's put a real actor as the main character on it? no. omg the sex symbol harry styles is available what if we just put a bunch of sex and nudity scenes on it and give a fuck about the real story behind it just because it's going to sell like water? yes yes yes yes yes! 
My Policeman 2022;10;      EU TÔ CHORANDO MUITO, CANALHAS 😭😭My Policeman é uma história lindamente trágica sobre o tempo desperdiçado e os perigos que se escondem em não ousar. Alternado entre presente e passado e com uma fotografia impecável ele respeita seu público o suficiente para desenhar cada um dos personagens principais como herói e vilão – permitindo-nos processar a rede resultante de conflitos emocionais por conta própria.Harry Styles traz uma espécie de luz e inocência para Tom que vemos…  
Graveyard Rats 2022;6; I was rooting for the rats the entire time 
Evil Dead 2013;10; FEAST ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER 
Barbarian 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Zach Cregger’s Hallway of Curiosities Barbarian delivers the most effective forty minutes of horror in 2022. We are talking about heart-pounding, pulling up the covers right below your eyes kind of horror. There are no monsters, no masked killers, or phantoms of the past to terrorize us during these forty minutes. These horrors are traded for double booked airbnbs in a ran down neighborhood. Instead of ghouls and zombies, we have Bill Skarsgard, who very likely seems like a serial…   
Barbarian 2022;8;  #12 Spooky Watch This one delivered on it’s hype. I didn’t see a single teaser or trailer for this movie, I just knew people were loving this one and some even called it “ This year’s Malignant “. Now that got me excited.I was blown away by the scope of this one. The writing and concept was amazing, the movie has a lot of surprises in it’s bag and with each revelations my jaw was on the floor. The…  
Let the Right One In 2008;10;  Let the Right One In. (2008). Directed by Tomas Alfredson.Let the Right One In (2008) is among our favorite vampire films. Tomas Alfredson created a sensational thought provoking film about morose topics. In addition, he crafted a film where jump scares are not the main attraction. In other words, the film is not entirely about the vampire genre and its elements but, it zeros in on the relationship between Oskar and Eli. Eli is an androgynous vampire who was…  
Sardar 2022;6; P.S.Mithran takes up a socially relevant content and delivers an infotainment heavy spy thriller packaged in an outright commercial template. Karthi steals the show and dominates the entire proceedings with his infectious charisma, especially as the terrific Sardar. The generic narrative lacks suspense with its set of logic loopholes, derivative negative characters and preachy expositions, yet the drama presents itself in a palatable manner and stays decently engaging throughout its runtime with exciting mass moments. It’s technically brilliant with well choreographed actions. Though GV misses out with his songs, he does a solid job with his background score. A good watch nevertheless. 
Top Gun: Maverick 2022;10; “Thank you for saving my life.”“It’s what my dad would've done.”Ugh, so great even upon a rewatch. Maverick and Rooster are a tremendous duo together in the final act. Have been wanting to rewatch this for a while to see if I love it as much as before, I still do! Best big budget blockbuster of the year! 
The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970;8; Dario Argento and Ennio Morricone is Giallo’s most iconic, greatest team-up. If Argento is the knife, Morricone is the leather gloves. 
The School for Good and Evil 2022;6; this was so corny and predictable… real cinema is back 
Saw II 2005;8;  Second movie of the franchise and it was really good, such a solid sequel.It’s about the same as the first one, this old man wants to make people learn to enjoy their lives before it’s too late. What better than sadistic traps to make that real.This movie develops the gore aspect deeper than the previous one, the story is very cleverly made, I like the connection between all the characters and also the smart puzzle that this man…  
The Silent Twins 2022;6;  This is tough because I really didn’t vibe with this for much of it’s runtime. It’s stylistically very strange with double exposures, stop motion animation segments, and just a generally weird aesthetic. But it’s also kind of fitting because this true life story is so strange that it’s difficult to translate to screen without these digressions into fantasy.  While I definitely came around to marginally liking this in the final moments, I couldn’t help but feel like I was more intrigued…  
TÁR 2022;10;  Cate Blanchett’s role in TAR is one of those performances that make acting seem incredibly difficult. Not only does she have to embody the passion, hubris, and self-obsession of Lydia Tar, she also has to believably perform as legendary conductor Lydia Tar. Talk about controlling time like a God, then do it in front of ninety classical musicians. Wax poetic about composing, then make it feel organic at a piano. Make us wonder whether it’s really about the music, then show us the answer…

Decision to Leave 2022;10;  “Decision to Leave” is the unholy union between the two halves of Park Chan-wook’s career. Park’s early works romanticised violent delights. His most recent stretch of films has delighted in violent romanticism. “Decision to Leave” is a bond between the two. Essentially, if Park loves murder so much, why doesn’t he just marry it? In “Decision,” he more or less… does. The film is a detective romance, a genre that should very well not exist, except within the realm of…  
The Witch 2015;8; reminded me of my time on the farm and my piece of shit goat (may he rest in peace)

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 1993;10; Warner Bros: Hey can you rush out a cheap cartoon Batman movie for kids?The filmmakers: Sure. Also we're gonna make it a tragedy about two adults whose reactions to trauma cost them their happiness, and it's going to have more elegant dialogue and character work and denser storytelling than any live-action Batman movie. 
Terrifier 2016;6;  A grimy cheapo shockfest who’s cover would’ve hooked your eye at the video store, Terrifier feels like some kinda sleazoid 80’s slasher B-side mixed with mid 00’s ultra violence sensibilities—a relative to movies like Maniac and The New York Ripper. Let’s cut right to it—this thing is Mean spirited, nasty, filled with tons of blood/violence bordering on torture porn, and features the maniacal Art the Clown—who has no issue sawing people in half or pulling out a gun and blowing someone…

Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 2022;6;  Will the families and kiddos enjoy it? Probably. But at what cost? Lyle is a semi mute crocodile. I say semi mute because he can sing, but that’s it. If words come out of his crocodile mouth, it’s a show tune.  Whether this is canon to the extensive lore of Lyle Lyle Crocodile or simply Shawn Mendes was so bad at voice acting the studio decided to have him only sing, I am not sure. But it does beg the…  
X 2022;8; I thought this was gonna be a movie about famous twitch streamer xqc but it’s just a bunch of people having sex and dying?? 
Lost in Translation 2003;4;  Sofia Coppola you fucking weirdo.I was really looking forward to this.Lost In Translation takes a look at a blossoming love affair between 2 Americans isolated in Japan. My problem with this is that I found the depiction of Japan and of Japanese people by the film to be, how do I say, dogshit. Like half of the film's runtime is Bill Murray making fun of the fact that the Japanese people don't have perfect English pronunciation while completely…  
12 Angry Men 1957;10; when they all start ignoring the racist... one of the best scenes in cinema history there is no reasonable doubt! 
Dead Heat 1988;8;  Mark Goldblatt, who edited numerous 80s classics and sequels including "The Howling" and "Halloween II," now takes the reins as director with a genre-bending film that blends all these elements to create one of the most exciting buddy cop movies of the 80s and possibly ever, notable for its shlocky and sleazy nature.Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo are terrific as these two brooding detectives who come upon a seemingly normal case, but that changes when the murder victim is…  
20th Century Girl 2022;8; My ignorant ass 5 minutes into the movie: "wow this is dumb af"My enlightened ass at the end of the movie: "WAT DA FUCK DIS MOVIE GENIUS HONESTLY ONE OF THE PUREST AND MOST INNOCENT FILMS IVE EVER SEEN LETSFUCKINGGOOOOOO-" 
What We Do in the Shadows 2014;10;  What We Do in the Shadows. 2014. Directed by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.“Just leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet!” What are you bidding on? I’m bidding on a table.” Vladislav and Viago before leaving for The Unholy Masquerade.After we picked ourselves off the floor from laughing so hard, What We Do in the Shadows (2014) delivers on all levels. It is a mockumentary that honors all historic vampire films and tropes while comedically…  
20th Century Girl 2022;8; cured my second lead syndrome but at what cost 
Alien 1979;10;  "This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off."Alien is a fantastic film. What makes "Alien" a cut above 99% of the Sci-Fi films is the acting and the characters. No one is thumping their chest how great they're, there's no super heroes, there's no sappy love interests, the banter, the dialogue is what you'd expect on a space shuttle mission once they are up and Ridley Scott went for straight steel cold realism.Alien has been able…  
Dressed to Kill 1980;8; A hooker and a geek join forces to end transphobia once and for all but they only make it worse. 
From Russia with Love 1963;8; This movie introduced me to the concept of drinking specific wines with specific foods and now every time I see someone eating cod and guzzling merlot I just assume they’re evil.Despite the plot being a little loose in places I love the vibe and characters in this. Begins Connery’s trifecta of James Bond performance perfection. Robert Shaw provides a great template for so many future Bond movie henchmen. All the other stuff on the train is phenomenal too. 
Halloween Ends 2022;2; Not only is Halloween Ends the worst movie in the entire Halloween franchise by a massive margin, it’s also one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.I’m so genuinely shocked by the quality of what I just watched that I don’t even know how to review this movie. I’m embarrassed for everyone involved in this film. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10; I thought this was really funny! It’s also inspiring. It made me decide to try my hand at writing music parody. I’m gonna goof on “Smooth” by Santana featuring Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty. So far I’ve only got a title (“chunky”) but I can already tell this is a turning point in my life. 
Eraserhead 1977;10; if i wasn't already convinced to not have kids, this movie definitely would've done the job 
Spree 2020;6; I have been meaning to watch this for a while now, not really sure why I avoided it for so long but I’m glad I finally got to it. I thought the concept was really cool and it had loads of laughs, the kills could have been a little bit better but overall it was entertaining my favorite things had to be Joe Keerys performance and reading the chat when more people started to join in lmao seeing MonkaW and MonkaS in chat gave me a good long chuckle.Wouldn’t mind watching this again down the  down the road. 
Office Space 1999;8; Watched this for the first time in 2021, only because of the That would be great meme, and now it is one of my all time favourite comedies. 
Black Adam 2022;6;  DC Extended Universe - RankedWe can smell what is cooking. It has been like that for too long. There is a reason so many films are in development hell and this is a reminder of why that isn't always bad but it still leaves so much left to be desired. It was hard to be excited for this. Not only have we seen this genre get oversaturated in recent times, but this is the next entry from one of…  
Smile 2022;2; :( 
Pearl 2022;8; PEARL is a perfect complementary film to Ti West’s “X” precisely because of how different it is while retaining its dark humor & gnarly violence. Mia Goth goes all in & slays the demented titular role, especially with a show-stopping monologue in the film’s climax. Loved its homage to the cinema of old, in this case, 1950s technicolor with a more classical film score, editing transitions and other fun aesthetic choices. 
Whiplash 2014;10; if terence fletcher was my teacher i would immediately kill myself

Over the Garden Wall 2014;10; i wish i could erase this from my mind so i could watch it all over again for the first time 
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On 2021;10;  Score : 9/10 ✅A funny and tender exploration of expressing yourself and making real connections. In addition to being heartwarming with its approach, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On aims for pure sincerity and aims even higher by becoming one of the most (if not the most) uplifting movies of 2022. This is the equivalent of a warm hug. The film is frequently funny and fundamentally adorable yet surprisingly melancholic on various occasions. In some ways, this is its…  
The Dark Corner 1946;8;  "Well, what else can I beat you at?"Private investigator Bradford Galt (Mark Stevens) finds himself dragged into the middle of a maelstrom when he catches a man in a white suit (William Bendix) following him and begins to investigate to figure out why. The trail leads him to Anthony Jardine (Kurt Kreuger), a former friend with whom the relationship turned acrimonious, and Hardy Cathcart (Clifton Webb), a wealthy art dealer. On his own, Galt is overmatched, but he has…  
Bros 2022;6; Bros is intermittently very funny. Funny to a degree most mainstream comedies rarely achieve. Unfortunately, at least for me, the film isn’t able to sustain that level of hilarity. I also think it suffers from some of the same flaws a lot of pictures produced by Judd Apatow do, predominantly a laborious runtime. Still, I think it is deserving of a more successful run at the box office. 
Petite Maman 2021;10;  We were girls together. I was 15 when my mom, sisters, and I moved into my mom’s childhood home. I ate meals in the same kitchen. I played in the same woods. I slammed the same doors. I stared into the same mirrors. I slept within the same four walls. Sometimes, late at night, I would lie awake and imagine she were beside me, my age, eager to whisper secrets in my ears. My mother’s childhood home was my home. “I’m…  
Casablanca 1942;10;  Cinematic Time Capsule1942 Marathon - Film #100Now look here, Casablanca, last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then, and it all adds up to one thing: you're getting on top of that 1942 ranking where you belong.CASABLANCA: "But, Cammmalot, no, I... I..."Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;6;  Stunning stop motion Henry Selick does it again👏👏Wendell and wild a sleepy ride.I’m Sorry but this was sadly disappointing after Henry Selicks previous cinematography like Coraline and Nightmare before Christmas I found the story slightly boring and not very spooky and felt like abit of a boring plot. Jordan peele and Keegan-Michael key had some funny and great scenes and were 100% the most entertaining part of the movie I just found myself losing interest and I was expecting…  
Sisters of Death 1976;4; Hold on, they were so eager to belong they willingly agree to play russian roulette as initiation? What kind of secret society was this, Illuminati? 
Barry Lyndon 1975;10;  me reaping, sowing, etci was resistant to watching this for SO long because every time you’d see a still or a clip of this at the oscars or whatever it was just him in the boat with his son or like they’re talking about The Candles again and it all seemed so stolid and boring and: YES the candles are cool. YES we love the lighting and the verisimilitude and stuff. Yes! HOWEVER this thing is so FUNNY and…  
No Way Out 1987;8; HORNY 
Raymond & Ray 2022;6; This movie had its merits. I’m a little disappointed though that Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke coming together turned out to be such a boring affair. I liked watching them but the story just wasn’t all there for me. Overall, a very forgettable movie. 
Barbarian 2022;8; This movie is about trickle-down economics. 
Smile 2022;6; The only props i'm gonna give this movie is for how much it embarrassed the recent Halloween sequel, and for that i'm thankful. 
An American Werewolf in London 1981;8; What a lovely little surprise. 
Bloody Muscle Body Builder in Hell 1995;8; A practical effects extravaganza from someone who can't afford to make a practical effects extravaganza. This movie might be derivative but Shinichi Fukazawa still does Sam Raimi proud I think.GROOVY! 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; the mental damage that THAT KILL SCENE gave to me, it will never heal 
Judex 1963;8;  Superheroes have never had such style as the likes of Georges Franju’s “Judex.” The director, who would put aside his own film career in its relative naissance to instead lead the Cinémathèque Française, demonstrates his devotion to the national tradition of his craft in “Judex,” more than in any of his other works. All flight and fantasy, the adventure tale is part homage and all heart. It is a feat of innovation that never forgets to doff its hat to…  
Smile 2022;8;  Easily one of the biggest surprises of the year, the marketing for Smile has done this movie a absolute disservice, it’s so much better than any of that obnoxious trailer footage that made the film look like absolute trash. Following psychologist Rosie Cotter (Sosie Bacon) as she begins to be haunted by a entity that feeds on trauma and misery, a entity that latched onto her after a mysterious suicide of her previous patient. This plot sounds generic as hell,…  
The House by the Cemetery 1981;6; Lucio Fulci, master of ocular trauma, herald of optic injury, commander of corneal carnage, why have you abandoned us? What have we done to deserve eye zooms? Lay your ophthalmic decimation upon us! 🔪👁🪓 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  “Show grief your fucking tits.”A movie that asks the question on nobody’s mind: “What if busted ass, broken down, sewer dwelling Michael Myers…had a little friend?”If Halloween Kills was the J6 of the franchise, this is the 9/11 aftermath, Green and McBride’s uncanny valley-written Haddonfield idiots struggling not to give in to anger, paranoia and rage. Weirdly enough, this is maybe the closest Green has come to capturing that awkward, self-destructive, forbidden love since All the Real Girls.…  
Stars at Noon 2022;6;  Stars at Noon is so bloated that all of its fleeting brilliance pales in comparison. Claire Denis clearly is a master of telling a sexually explicit story with style, but with such a meatless story, no magic shall be created here.Stars at Noon is as political as it's romantic, centering around the lingering romance between two foreigners in Nicaragua during its political unrest, as well as the pandemic. Notorious for its sex scenes during its Cannes premiere, Stars at…  
Return to Seoul 2022;8; Seoul-set, French dialogue...goth clubbing... sad girl... I was always set up to love this. Blown away by Park Ji-min's performance and the way she internalizes her pain and then leaves behind a trail of chaos. There's one throwaway line/side plot that is maybe played for comedy (?) that I thought was random and left a bad taste and I wish it wasn't included at all, but the rest of the film is so beautiful and powerful. Gutted. 
Buster's Mal Heart 2016;6;  This was a letdown. This is a movie I've had on my Netflix queue for years, and maybe because of all that wait, the movie just didn't measure up to my expectations, which weren't high to begin with as I wasn't expecting much.Essentially, the film has a good concept and Malek does his thing, but it all ends up feeling pretty random. There is no clear premise, and nothing appears to make sense. The cinematography is excellent. The score…  
Hocus Pocus 2 2022;6; “you attract what you fear” aaaaah hannah waddingham milf witch aaaaah 🤪 
Godzilla vs. Biollante 1989;10;  It's finally happening! Even though Jozlyn is into Japanese entertainment in general — and has even expressed an interest in watching some tokusatsu shows like Ultraman and Kamen Rider — she's never sounded all that interested when the subject of Godzilla came up. Having bounced off a couple of the more serious Godzilla films, she'd decided the franchise wasn't really her cup of tea. All that changed, however, after she ended up enjoying Shin Ultraman and I explained that a…  
My Neighbor Totoro 1988;10;  “Everybody, try laughing. Then whatever scares you will go away!” - Tatsuo KusakabeI had somewhat of a bad day yesterday and at the end of it I felt a little drained. So I did what I would advise anyone in a situation like to do, I put in My Neighbor Totoro. I noticed, when writing about Studio Ghibli/ Hayao Miyazaki films, there is a strong tendency of repeating myself. The animation and music are brilliant, the characters are fantastically…  
Falling for Christmas 2022;10; perfect holiday romcom. no notes. it’s so healing to see lindsay serving and thriving and delivering. my heart is so full. the end credit bloopers and lilo singing jingle bell rock were the icing on an immaculate cake. SHE’S BACK, Y’ALL !!!also lindsay’s head-to-toe pink look??????? EXACTLY 💅✨ 
Get Carter 1971;8; It’s Rob Spencer Day on Watch This List! LB’s very own mosquitodragon is on the pod this week discussing his top 5 favorite gritty crime films. Audio’s here, video’s here, check them out when you can. Had great fun chatting with Rob in our affectionately titled episode—A Doggedly Nasty Piece of Business—with nods to various genres in-between. Finally checked off some classic bangers from my own watchlist, too. Enjoy. 
Dreams in the Witch House 2022;4; This is probably my least favorite entry so far. Rupert Grint was pretty good, but the story of his missing sister just wasn’t very compelling. There were a couple fun moments when the witch was chasing them through the woods, but aside from that this was largely forgettable. Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. Rupert Grint and Laura Linney in Driving Lessons2. Laura Linney and Kevin Bacon in Mystic River 
Causeway 2022;8; full of emotions and jennifer lawrence’s acting was amazing as always 
V for Vendetta 2005;10; Remember remember... the fifth day of No Dazed November.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked9/10 
The Shawshank Redemption 1994;10; -First he doesn't like it that prison-Both He feels comfortable with that prison-Third He really think it's home-Fourth He doesn't even want to leave that prison Even when he came outThere are many positive sides that can be taken from this filmI don't think the ending of this film he did thatWhat a struggle👏👏 
The Last Temptation of Christ 1988;6; Dafoe as an edgy Jesus, Harvey Kettle as Judas and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate. All very weird.Interestingly it goes off grid towards the end and has its moments of strange fascination. Overall it feels like an art house experiment with a big budget that was more of a creative indulgence. Still, its a million time better than Pasolini's wet weekend The Gospel According To St. Matthew. 
Where'd You Go, Bernadette 2019;10; Bernadette is a menace and I’m so here for it. I can relate to her total aversion to people in general. What a great role by Cate Blanchett. She is superb here in this wonderfully eccentric character. I also loved how well Kristen Wiig played a gnat. Such a quirky and unique film. 
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10; Ugly crying 
Beauty and the Beast 1991;10; "Stockholm syndrome this," "stockholm syndrome that." How bout you stock up on four dozen eggs every morning to help you get large

Taxi Driver 1976;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Killing myself in front of an underaged prostitute to drastically change the trajectory of her life  
When Harry Met Sally... 1989;10; rob reiner dared to ask “can we dress the most average looking men ever in autumnal city fashion, and will it make them sexy?” 
It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown 1966;10; Kicking off my Halloween marathon and what better way to start than with a movie about pure fucking bullying and delusion

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004;10; ah yes my favorite genre of filmpain 
Re-Animator 1985;10; bitches be like "this is my comfort character" and it's an insane scientist who murdered someone with a shovel 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; It may be 01:14am, and I may be drunk, but I mean this sincerely and from the bottom of my heart.Cinema does not get any more irreverent, more joyous, more camp, more musical, more sexy, more nostalgic, more genius than this.Send it in to space, pass it on to the forming bacteria on Mars, preserve it at all costs.Don't dream it, be it. 
Trainspotting 1996;10; ewan macgregor in a crop top saved cinema just saying 
Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood 2019;6;  With an unclear storyline and choppy flow, this thriller drama wasn’t one of Quentin Tarantino's best films. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt as Cliff, a declining actor, and his stunt double trying to revive their careers in Hollywood’s golden age. Both men deliver charismatic energy together but separately, Pitt carries the film. And I wanted to stick with his story. Margo Robbie as Sharon Tate was underutilized. It’s a stylish good-looking film but it gets sidetracked…  
Goliath and the Vampires 1961;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciTo call this film a Corbucci film, according to some accounts, a stretch since according to many he had very little input in this and many attribute the direction more to Giacomo Gentilomo.Whatever the case, this picture, which belongs to the subgenre known as "peplum" (epic films made in Italy with mythical, historical, or biblical themes), was rather intriguing. Very little of the alleged vampires actually show on…  
Out There Halloween Mega Tape 2022;8;  Happy Halloween everybody! Hope it was a good one.After watching WNUF Halloween Special and falling in love with it, I was told to check its sequel out. I can confidently say if you loved WNUF you’ll love this.It’s the same format, a bootleg vhs containing a live broadcast during Halloween with commercials and all. This time it’s a live broadcast of the show Out There, a late night paranormal investigation show I’m sure I would’ve stayed up late…  
The Viewing 2022;10; Spooky Season First Watch #28 of 31:Holy. Fucking. Shit.Holy. Fuck.Wow.Gonna watch it again. Now. 
Shin Godzilla 2016;10;  "The fact is that there has been a large number of victims."A monster movie stripped down to its barest bones. An anti-kaiju picture. An anti-Godzilla picture. The horror of a national disaster. The horror in its bueacratic response. The collective optimism at hand. The strength and will of the Japanese people.There isn't another Godzilla film like Shin Godzilla and there won't be again. Director Hideaki Anno and co-directors Shinji Higuchi and Katsuro Onoue crafted a picture that furiously…

Aftersun 2022;10; As I left the theater, a man pointed at me and said “Oh, this n**** been CRYING crying.” 
In Search of Tomorrow 2022;8;  Following the two sections of "In Search of Darkness," the mighty Callisto brought to my attention this five-hour documentary on 1980s sci-fi, that outlines the relevance of the genre and what makes it so remarkable not only in cinema, but also in society as a whole. In many ways, it is a genre that is second only to drama in terms of commenting on today's society and the future that lies ahead.The interviewees ranged from actors like Jesse Ventura…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Right out of the gate, after seeing these three new Halloween movies, I have to say that my ass is quite grateful now that we got Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria remake rather than the one that was going to be made originally by David Gordon Green.Oh, and while we're talking about director Luca Guadagnino, I can also say that I can't wait to see David Gordon Green's ass be gobbled up on screen in Bones and All.Pause for a…   
TÁR 2022;8;  wanted to add more because the way this movie is being discussed seems to sidestep completely its actual merits and its actual faults. Tar's argument with the Juilliard student is emblematic - Field treats it as less a culture war ethnography and more a theatrical moment of self-sabotage on Lydia's part, as she refuses to stop performing "Tar" for even the moment it would take to form an honest and equitable connection with the kid, who is portrayed as reactionary,…  
My Policeman 2022;4; terminei me perguntando “então é isso?” 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Give Colin Farrell’s bushy, caterpillar eyebrows & furrowed moue the Oscar already. That man’s expressive brow is a masterpiece equal to Mozart. I’d be his drinking buddy just to watch his pout form glorious compositions. Forget feckin piddlin’ around with the fiddle. 
Terrifier 2 2022;6;  "It's not like this night could get any worse."Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) comes back and begins another rampage of slaughter, this time targeting the friends and family of teenager Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera). Terrifier 2 is a gruesome grind house gore-fest that seems to be part of the growing counter reaction to the more thoughtful, slower, mood based direction the genre has been moving in. There's no attempt to get deep here, just a monstrous figure committing…  
RRR 2022;10; this got me thinking about how deteriorated the notion of spectacle is in the american cinema now. our spectacle is entirely metatextual, just watching different IP appear on screen together is supposed to be thrilling. RRR gets what actual spectacle should look like. absolutely electrifying from beginning to end. i’ll leave it at that bc i’m less familiar with indian cinema than i should be but i had an absolute blast watching this, laughing and cheering more than i’ve done in a theater in years. if you have the opportunity to see this in a theater do NOT pass it up 
Saw 2004;10; Quentin Tarantino’s favourite poster 
The Truman Show 1998;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  the more i think about the ending, the more i feel bad for truman. the way he’s entering a world where he expects to finally be free and in charge of his own destiny, but is actually entering an environment where everyone knows him & has watched him his whole life, and will treat him differently based on what they have learned to expect of him.  
Gone Girl 2014;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I'M THE CUNT YOU MARRIEDTHE ONLY TIME YOU LIKED YOURSELF WAS WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO BE SOMEONE THIS CUNT MIGHT LIKEI'M NOT A QUITTERI'M THAT CUNTI'VE KILLED FOR YOUWHO ELSE CAN SAY THAT?YOU THINK YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH A NICE MIDWESTERN GIRL?NO WAY BABYI'M IT  
Force Majeure 2014;10;  But the truth is when reality is staring you in the face and you're afraid to die, very few of us are heroic. The expectations we set for ourselves sometimes, or most of the time, weigh more than the expectations set by society. Yet, even if we do recognize the lunacy of the roles- whether that be in marriage, platonic friendships, or parenthood- we still abide by them for the sake of normalcy. Its an interesting paradox that Östlund portrays…  
Top Gun: Maverick 2022;8;  Haven't been on much because today is my birthday and I've just been so busy this week with stuff leading up to it. I'm sorry if I have missed some of your wonderful reviews and hopefully can get back in the swing of writing and reading next week. Watched this again this morning, just because I needed something fun and easy. Liked it more on my second watch. Probably the best action movie of the year, and a fantastic sequel.…  
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg 1964;10; DO NOT let the prettiness of this movie fool you. it's just plain sad 
My Father's Dragon 2022;6;  Cartoon Saloon is very good at this. The Kilkenny-based studio behind “The Secret of Kells” and “Song of the Sea” has emerged as a powerhouse in recent years. Its evocatively rendered 2D films drawing on ancient Celtic imagery — and the traditional storytelling charm that comes with it — sets its work apart from so much of the craven slop that passes for family entertainment in the age of “Lightyear” and “The League of Super-Pets.” If cinema is a crumbling…

Whispering Corridors 1998;8;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberOne of the earliest films produced as part of the South Korean cinematic boom that followed the lifting of censorship after the end of the country's military dictatorship and made it possible for previously taboo subjects to be explored.In this case, we have a tale that blends the supernatural with psychological horror while also commenting on student abuse—not only from students, but also from teachers—and how it can lead to not…

Terrifier 2016;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  so like.. which one of you is gonna stop me from getting a tattoo of dawn's death?  
Roadgames 1981;8; Stacey Keach and his dingo haul meat across Australia, whiling away the hours playing car classics such as "I Spy", "Punch-buggy" and "being stalked by a serial killer." Also features Jamie Lee Curtis as yet ANOTHER extremely hot hitch-hiker! You better believe I was loving this one. 
The Turn of the Screw 1999;6;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberThis is a vast improvement over the abomination that was the adaption with Finn and Davis from the past decade, but it still can't compare to the brilliant 1961 production. Also, it annoys and disappoints me that the movie devotes so much attention to promoting Colin Firth, even though he doesn't appear in the picture for more than a minute. Despite this, the picture does have its merits. Each time a ghost…  
Ichi the Killer 2001;8; *briefly considers trying to write something maybe minimally profound about humanity’s propensity for violence and vengeance, with trauma and predisposition as contagion and catalyst, symbiosis between stylish causality and substantive morality in film, etc etc* …*sees top review on Letterboxd with 1,400+ likes* 😕🤦🏻‍♂️ why even fucking bother lmao 
The Canterville Ghost 1996;6;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberBen Kingsley... I mean... Patrick Stewart stars in this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's popular short story.I haven't watched many renditions of the story, but I have a feeling a lot was changed to make it more kid-friendly. In light of that, I was shocked by how dark and tense the scene was where Virginia a pre-SCREAM (the picture would not be released until 11 months later that year) Neve Campbell and…  
Perfect Blue 1997;8; my sister watches this movie once and decides to be mima for a halloween party we had the night we watched the movie. Mf put together her costume in 10 hours and she looked amazing, what a gal. also this movie is amazing but also what the actual fuck? perfect blue ran so black swan could fly. 
Frances Ha 2012;10; wow she's literally me 
TÁR 2022;10;  Hard to write something about a movie as dense as that but here goes. It feels like a biopic for a person who doesn’t exist yet most definitely exists, an adaptation of a book that wasn’t written and just a really great movie in all. This movie is pretty long yet never did I feel it drag or get repetitive. It just feels like a long story that moves at its own pace. It’a just amazing in a way I’d…  
Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me 2022;10; Grammy’s Emmy’s Oscars’ give em all to her 
Hellraiser 2022;4; Midraiser 
Speak No Evil 2022;8; What happens when the boundaries of our civility are pushed beyond repair? Nothing, or embarrassingly, most of us when put in awkward situations continue to be polite to avoid confrontation. A phenomenon that Speak No Evil uses as a vehicle to deliver one of most uncomfortable and suffocating horror films of the entire year. 70 minutes of cringe inducing scenarios and then 20 minutes of overwhelming terror. I loved it but I never want to experience it again. 
Men 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  400% more birth than anticipated  
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;4;  Not sure how to explain why I didn't love this, so I'll start with what I did like: I LOVED the costumes and how Joy looks like a Bjork album cover towards the end of the movie. The editing was good. The visuals were a lot of fun, I loved all the confetti and glitter throw up. The lighting was great!! Visually the movie was great!! Also having to do something statistically improbable to jump universes was very silly and…  
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;10; Once every few years, a film comes along that is so audacious, funny, original, technically dazzling, and thematically resonant, we feel blessed to have been alive to see it. This is such a film. It spoke to me on such a core level that it felt genetically engineered to meet me at this point in my life. It may be my new favorite movie of all time. No joke. 
Jujutsu Kaisen 0 2021;10; none of this would’ve happened if gojo and geto had just kissed 
Poltergeist 1982;8; Love the teenage daughter. She eats cereal and makes phone calls. Never once has a spooky ghost encounter. She’s just at a party while her entire family is getting coffin flopped. 
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 2013;10; catching fire is to the hunger games as prisoner of azkaban is to harry potter 
Poltergeist 1982;6; i love how their teenage daughter just fuckin up and left as soon as freaky shit started happening bc that would be me

Catherine Called Birdy 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  There should be more movies where Andrew Scott and Billie Piper are married.  
Pearl 2022;4; some how worse and more boring than X (which i hated) you can very much tell how quickly this was conceived by the lazy writing and terrible pacing i’ve seen people call this a good character study but i honestly think it has nothing interesting to say - maybe i’m biased anyways this just feels like poorly done fan service only nice thing i can say about it is the colors are pretty and mia goth does the best with what she’s given ti west please stop making movies 
Misery 1990;8; Me locking Quentin Tarantino in my apartment after his 10th movie forcing him to write more 
Southland Tales 2006;10; Good news heathens the Southland Tales Master Cut is available to stream and download now! Going in to this project I wanted to create a middle ground between the Cannes and Theatrical and I couldn't be more happier with how it turned out (also sneaked in six additional needle drops how about that). Shoutout to Cecil Selwyn who did the polishing and color grading you were a massive help (that blueish ethereal murky vibe they nailed it). I don't think I've enjoyed the film as much I have now and that's saying alot, enjoy guys! 
Pulp Fiction 1994;10; I painted art while watching a work of art with my best friend who's favorite movie of all time is this P(ulp)iece of art. Damn I'm a crazy cinephile 
Harold and Maude 1971;8; A quirky tale of two lonely outsiders who seem ill-fitted for the jigsaw that is life, but somehow manage to fit together just right.Harold strikes an almost ghost like figure for the majority of the movie. The introduction of Maude—a woman whose background was just too serious for her to ever take anything serious again—brings colour back into the young boy’s life. Both Harold and Maude were precisely what each other needed at exactly the right time.Loved it! 
Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles 1975;2;  My Criterion Challenge 2022: 23/52#16 Directed by Chantal Akerman This is probably the first strand type movie because this was one of the most boring films I’ve ever watched. Nothing happens in this film. There’s literally no point to the scenes where she does chores. It’s like the five minute pie scene from A Ghost Story, except there’s no purpose to any of it. Sure, something happens at the end, but it’s not worth waiting 3 hours for the payoff.…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; I’ve seen enough. I’m casting my vote for Jenny as best supporting Donkey in a motion picture. 
Black Panther 2018;10; Rewatching this movie before I watch Black Panther: Wakanda Forever made me miss Chadwick Boseman Even more. But I’m actually excited to watch the sequel pretty soon. But overall, Wakanda Forever! 
Morbius 2022;4;  Alrigh’ put me in the It Ain’t As Bad As Sum’ve You Lot Made It Out T’Be But It Still Ain’t Very Fuckin’ Good group. It’s got sum kind’ve charmin’ stuff goin’ fer it.

He’s got good chemis’ry…  
I Want You Back 2022;8; Yes!!! Wonderful!!!!!!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  Remember Who We Are.It is a miracle this film exists.Wakanda Forever already had so much resting on it before the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman so the strength needed to bring this story to the screen is unfathomable. Boseman made such a significant impact on the Marvel universe and the industry as a whole so the film's sole job becomes to give a tribute fitting for a hero of his stature. The whole film has a sombre tone…  
Spider-Man 2002;8; Remember when blockbusters actually had things like “scenes”? What a concept!

Elf 2003;10; why does this movie actually make me feel like santa really exists.... i mean do we have evidence that he DOESN'T exist???? i'm just sayin 
Pink Floyd: The Wall 1982;10; So beautifulThanks Alan Parker and Pink Floyd 
Go 1999;6; Kinetic, youthful, and so very, very 90’s.One of the better post Pulp Fiction/ Trainspotting imitators. Banging soundtrack too. 
The Viewing 2022;10;  So much style over very little substance..bascically a woozy atmosphere hogging over a fairly straightforward shapeless plot, drugs infused daydreaming in a reddish chamber under a constant smudge of glossy yellow, bullshitting, more dreaming, more bullshitting on newer prospects in seeking marginal pride through drug-heavy words of translucent minds from all areas of talents, pathetic whimsy dream ride rollercoaster and humiliation in struggling with a richer influence that not only highlights your monstrous outline but also imprisons you within the…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; I can't help but relate this to Fargo in the use of comedy and linguistics to mask a much darker storyline. However, rather than the comedy lightening the mood on unpredictable death, this film uses comedy to lighten the mood on our inner mind and insecurities which you could argue is worse than death. One of the funniest and yet one of the most haunting films of the year, letting the audience reflect on their own insecurities towards change and fulfillment in life. Colin Farrell delivers the best performance of the year in McDonagh's best film from his already incredible catalog. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;2;  Its been years now since I started dipping my toes into film outside of whatever shit was showing at the multiplex. Not even a decade, and yet, I struggle remembering my life before it. Works that have reshaped my perspective on the world around me, that have changed me as a person, that has allowed me to live the lives of others over the course of a few hours, allowed me to experience emotions I never thought could be felt,…  
Thief 1981;10;  ***The ElCochran90 Discord Server 's Watch Party Redeem #7*****Recommended by ollie.***Find full updated list here*.For some subliminal reason, the checklist of my initial expectations included the best James Caan ever. It is inexplicable, my unconscious side of the mind did that. I received much more than that: Caan is a complex exploration of the criminal and domestically frustrated mind incapable of establishing solid, stable relationships due to what his ideology makes him think it’s his duty for…

The Autopsy 2022;8;   Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities - 3/8 Prepare your stomach. When you have a case come to this. It will never bold too well. Except for audiences. It is the next entry in a series of evil cabinets that spins into the mysterious occurrences of the human body.Medical horror is tough viewing. It is not for everyone. Including myself. Sometimes the test and the limits pushed by such brutality can only make the experience all the more entertaining…  
The Good Nurse 2022;6; Jessica Chastain is incredible but this felt 5h long 
The Stepfather 1987;8; There is something very sinister about a mild mannered, average Joe/plain Jane turning out to be a homicidal maniac. It's the implication that you really can't trust anyone, that you're never actually safe. That sweet old lady walking her dog? That loving, family man? That Canadian woman you're having virtual watch parties with? They could all be out to get you. Scary!O’Quinn gives one hell of a performance here. A fantastic movie. 
Bram Stoker's Dracula 1992;8; On sheer ambitious craft alone this film is one of the best, especially when it employs old-school techniques and barely any VFX that have aged so well, even more in today world of CG-heavy filmmaking down to the smallest detail that’s been painstakingly recreated here. I always wished some of the acting was as pure and inspired but having been a while since I’ve seen it, all the fence-swinging in the performances seem to match the CinemaOperatic flourishes Coppola’s bringing. The opening 5 minutes have some of the most amazing shots/compositions Coppola (or anyone) had ever captured on film. 
All the Light in the Sky 2012;8; love middle-class white women talking about their problemswanna be one some day 
The Autopsy 2022;8; David Prior does it again with his Cabinet of Curiosities episode. The Autopsy returns to the gradual contained tension of AM1200 but with a scope recalling The Empty Man’s genre-blurring sprawl. Fascinating and gruesome cosmic body horror within the bounds of small-town noir mystery, effortlessly carried by the charismatic gravitas of F. Murray Abraham and Glynn Turman. I was engaged by the web of narrative set-up, then hooked by the grisly Lovecraftian battle of wits. The outstanding peak of the series thus far, I need to see what Prior doing John Langan or Nick Cutter or Laird Barron looks like, give the man all the money. 
TÁR 2022;8;  Everyone knows someone like this, even if they're not in this domain. I have seen identical callous personalities abusing their power in various roles, mainly supervisors and especially in grad schools. Many see characters like this in their own households, families and lovelife. The performances are great but certain parts - especially at the beginning - are pretentious, overlong or too inside art world / niche view that not everyone will enjoy this movie. It has a bit of Birdman's…  
The Faculty 1998;8; It has some really tough competition, but I do believe this movie wins the title for most aggressively bad Hartnett hair style. It's like bad bedhead with some kind of a flip-out flourish to it? Anyway, it's scarier than the worm aliens, really. 
The Curse of Bridge Hollow 2022;6; Every time i read the title i just instantly forget it. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; Wonderful, tragic, dark, and hilarious in all the ways I expect from McDonagh at this point. Colin/Gleason are a predictably great pair, but the entire supporting cast easily matches them both. Two extra things: 1. Despite Ireland being a popular and striking film location, this one manages to capture the harsh beauty of Irish landscape in a way no other film I've seen has. 2. I love that this film really commits to the pace. It never breaks with the slow deliberate tempo that really helps give you a sense of the place as much as the people and scenery. 
My Father's Dragon 2022;8; can always count on cartoon saloon to deliver beautiful animation with a beautiful message to go with it! kinda does feel like it’s aimed more for children than their other films but was still definitely worth catching on the big screen 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  this fixed everything that didn’t work in the first one and that’s precisely why i think this is such a good franchise concept. make 20 more of these and i would be seated 20 more times.i feel to add that, though i said this “fixed” everything, i’m being slightly disingenuous. this had the same old issues. too many subplots of various degrees of importance that cause the runtime to be bloated and at times poorly paced, but all of…  
X 2022;8; 2022 RankedFirstly I’ll apologise for the lack of activity recently, just haven’t been in the mood for films. Thought I’d watch one of the most popular films of 2022 and one of the first 2022 films I added to my watchlist in X. All I have to say about this film is that Mia Goth is off the charts, just watch it for her. 
Graveyard Rats 2022;6; When digging inside a grave,It helps to be really brave. But some may wonder,If six feet under,Maybe don't follow that cave. 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; this is so sad alexa play cutting my fingers off by turnover 
Brute Force 1947;6;  There's little ambiguity to be found in the world of Brute Force: men are either weak or strong, trustworthy or turncoats, robustly heterosexual or snivelingly gay and dangerously repressed. Burt Lancaster, of course, is the representation of everything positive the film and its environment have to offer: despite being a criminal who professes to care about no one but himself, he's in fact a saint who is in love with a wheelchair-bound innocent (who he loves so much he ...…  
Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022;10; Superman made you believe a man could fly.Everything Everywhere all at Once will make you believe a man can be beaten to death with a dildo.

Bros 2022;4;  For a movie so focused on the importance of mainstreaming queer history, it seems to care very little for the queer films that came before it. Bobby and Aaron discuss how often straight male actors win praise for playing gay cowboys, but beyond digs at both “Brokeback Mountain” and “The Power of the Dog” (directed by and starring straight people), the only other queer film mentioned is Luca Guadagnino's “Call Me By Your Name” in a throwaway joke about how…  
Fight Club 1999;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  bro this fella gay asf for hallucinating brad fucking pitt in slutty little outfits to hang out with

Suspiria 2018;10; tik tok dances with the girls <3 
Shaun of the Dead 2004;10; this is what EVERY other zombie comedy ever is missing: a scene where the characters beat a zombie to death with pool sticks in-sync to queen's "don't stop me now" 
Trick 'r Treat 2007;8; my little pumpkin mans is the halloween cop lmao. 
Naane Varuvean 2022;6; Dhanush’s terrific performance and the outstanding musical score from Yuvan are the major positives of this psychological horror thriller. The first hour had some really interesting choices with solid atmospheric thrills, setting it up perfectly for the story reveal. But unfortunately what follows is too predictable, bland and underwhelming. Technically, the movie is solid. Special mention to its remarkable cinematography. What had a promising potential to turn out memorable, ends up a passable average watch. 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; such a fun movie and way better than the first! millie shines bright and i can’t wait to see what the future holds for her🌟 
Pearl 2022;8; That near endless take at the end was SO uncomfortable. I laughed after the shot was cut because I didnt know how else to react. What a fantastic performance by her. 
Lot 36 2022;4; You'd be better off watching Storage Wars instead. At least you won't be bored and the people have personality 
Pearl 2022;8; oh mein gott zis girl is kuntenserven 
Frankenhooker 1990;8;  frank henenlotter goes stuart gordon mode and turns bride of frankenstein into an 80s mad-scientist body horror comedy. really like that this follows its gruesome, juvenile logic about bodily autonomy right to the very end and patty mullen sends it all home with her pretty spectacular physical performance. wobbling around in her purple bra/miniskirt and powder-faced make-up, each limb looking clumsily stitched together and doing these stiff, animated lip curls, i was dying at the part where she's just walking…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; The Banshees of Inisherin is brilliant beyond belief. Darkly Hilarious, emotional, & Richly layered with themes of fate, friendship, & death. Colin & Brendan were stunning! Martin McDonagh though might of just directed & wrote his best film of his career one of the most emotional films of 2022 weirdly enoughCLICK HERE FOR FULL REVIEW 
Halloween Ends 2022;4; 2022 RankedHalloween RankedThe scariest thing about this film was the mullet. 
The Black Phone 2021;8;  The Black Phone. 2021. Scott Derrickson.Scott Derrickson (Doctor Strange, 2016, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, 2022, Sinister, 2012) directed and co-wrote an effective screenplay with Joe Hill (Horns, 2013 & Creepshow, 1982) and C. Robert Cargill (Doctor Strange, 2016) that mixes elements of supernatural horror and very down to earth horror. We were immediately absorbed into the narrative. To see Jeremy Davies (Secretary, 2002, Twister, 1996, Saving Private Ryan, 1998) as an abusive alcoholic parent was unsettling. Once…  
Halloween Kills 2021;6; i want to be as dedicated in life as michael is to making laurie’s life a living hell 
Halloween II 2009;8;  Whoa, brutal AF!Okay, the Rob Zombie Halloween duology is actually good, like, really good. The dialogue in either movie isn't the greatest, and some of the performances are a bit clunky, but I love how the Shape and the mythology is reimagined. Michael's troubled upbringing makes sense to me and it does a decent enough job of explaining why he is the way he is. These movies succeed best when Zombie strays from what has been established in previous…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Michael Myers’ body crowd surfs before being trash compacted, and I suppose it’s worth sitting through this to see that. Aside from that, what an insanely anticlimactic climax.  
The Thing 1982;10; talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, MASTERPIECE 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; EVIL ENDS TONIGHT! 
Napoleon Dynamite 2004;6; This movie feels like being in Goodwill 
Blue Velvet 1986;10;  🎶She wore Blue Velvet...🎶Blue Velvet is a creepy, surreal film noir, full of haunting and often hilarious scenes. It's a masterpiece that lets me know why David Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro, beautiful cinema.Blue Velvet is a simple amateur sleuthing story, but the genius is in the telling of it. It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved, although it isn't and…  
Let the Corpses Tan 2017;8;  2nd Hélène Cattet, 2nd Bruno Forzani (after The Strange Colour of Your Body's Tears)Blood. Sun. Sweat. A woman who pisses gold and lactates champagne. Let the Corpses Tan is what it feels like to be dropped into the sensorial middle of a EuroCrime film. It's a rough terrain of sexual obsession, avarice and incredible violence, a film that's remarkably tense despite the way it stretches the drama out through repetition and enhanced time. It develops an overwhelming atmosphere of…  
Mr. & Mrs. Smith 2005;8; An ordinary action-comedy that can convince us with its hot cast. I mean who needs a plot when you have Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the cast? 
Twilight 2008;8; O que posso concluir socialmente deCrepúsculo no cinema é: a instituição LOBOS está FALIDA. Todo mundo gritou na aparição de todos os personagens, quando Jacob apareceu foi um silêncio SEPULCRAL. Taylor Lautner, o maior ato de sua carreira pífia foi ter um caso com a Taylor Swift. Pattinson está mais forte do que nunca. 
Barbarian 2022;10; Damn she packin😩😩🤤 
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Fellow fans of out there sequels like Season of the Witch, Curse of Michael Myers, A New Beginning and Jason Goes to Hell should be pleased.Everyone else, buckle the fuck up.My favorite of the Gordon Green trilogy. -----------------------------------Halloween Ranked 
Argentina, 1985 2022;8;  Por mas que a uno le encante y sea una proeza indiscutible, es un deber señalar que La Flor termina siendo una película para pocos, o mejor dicho, que sólo ven unos pocos. Por más que haya cine de aventuras, terror clase B, espionaje, musical y demás, sólo la cinefilia soporta una película de 14 horas dónde las historias ni siquiera tienen un final. La intenté recomendar mil veces a personas que no son del palo, y resulta imposible. No…

A Clockwork Orange 1971;10; I want Stanley Kubrick to come back from the dead and explain this to me. 
Blade 1998;8; "Some motherfuckers are always tryna ice skate uphill." > "I am Iron Man." 
Black Adam 2022;6; This felt like a mashup of all superhero movie elements we've seen so far... from Black Panther tech and geography... to Doctor Strange magic... to Man of Steel combat... to Iron Man's helmet view... to Ant-man powers with Deadpool's outfit... etc etc.That can make the film cool to watch. But it also kinda makes it lack its own identity. 
Baby Blood 1990;8;  Brain Damage meets Titane at an Posession party in this story about a young woman who gets impregnated with a diabolical alien, demonic species that pushes her to murder people.French Rachel Sennott is superb as this disturbed woman, notably through her eyes and whole physical performance, one believes that this woman is deranged, yet there is a certain purity in her appearance and the way she behaves, producing an even more horrifying portrayal reminiscent of Adjini in the aforementioned…  
Barbarian 2022;10; My face hurts from smiling for 100 minutes. 
Terrifier 2 2022;6; idk still can’t entirely get past the juvenile edgy shock approach of these movies, and the clunky writing + bland visual style doesn’t support this kind of length, but the enthusiasm behind all the viscerally brutal gore effects is palpable and this has the advantage over the first of actually having a character worth rooting for. The hype and cult surrounding these movies can be weirdly off-putting and I don’t really wish to revisit them anytime soon but it’s nice to see the slasher genre still kicking. The little demon girl was creepier than Art. 
The Haunting 1963;8; A house that was born bad and eats trauma for breakfast faces its biggest challenge yet: loud lesbian lodgers. 
Terrifier 2 2022;8; I think Damien Leone resurrected the corpse of the Marquis de Sade just to have him write the script to this movie. Some adjectives to describe Terrifier 2- depraved- mean- unrelenting- brutal- scary- disgusting- shocking- bloody- gory- bad taste- vile- vicious So basically, you need to see it.Trust me, it'll shock/scare/disgust you way more than any of the "elevated horror" that A24 is putting out.

Jackie Brown 1997;10;  The needledrops. The long takes. The close-ups. The ponytail. The ass that used to be beautiful. And the performances. My dear sweet god, the performances. Not only does this movie never get old, it's only gotten wayyyyyy better every single time I've watched it.Huge declaration incoming. Pam Grier and Robert Forster may be the hottest, most likeable, badass couple to ever grace the screen. Please do me the favor of easily and immediately proving me wrong in the comments,…  
Strange Tales 1949;6;  1st Jean FaurezA brief bit of counting reveals that for me, this is my 27th Poe adaptation, of which about 17 I’ve seen since having Lb. As they go, this falls about the middle of the pack. There’s really interesting stuff in here, but there’s a lot of dross, largely when the film isn’t actually adapting Poe. The opening wraparound and the first story are dreary slogs, especially when the subtitles can’t quite make up their mind which sister…  
The Autopsy 2022;8; The Autopsy. 2022. Directed by David Prior.Guillermo Del Toro’s Netflix show is filled with exceptional episodes. David Prior’s direction shined in Episode three of his Cabinet of Curiosities with F. Murray Abraham (Dr. Carl Winters). This episode was much like Alien (1979) meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978). Winters is called in to examine the bodies of coal miners but finds himself in a body snatcher like situation with a highly intelligent extraterrestrial parasitic life form. The pacing was perfect, the narrative well written, and the acting was superb. Viewed on Netflix. 
Bros 2022;8;  Films like Bros are important, a take on the formulaic romcom genre, but this time giving representation to a group that don’t get seen as much on the big screen as they should. The movie definitely sticks to the formulas that you would expect from the genre, there’s nothing new storyline wise here, you can predict the entire film, but the charm of this film comes from the freshness of the representation that is seen, giving a voice to so…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; We still struggle to depict the true scale of these wars, but the horror and futility is amazingly well captured. The combat sequences were exceptional, almost taking inspiration from video games, in having cameras over the shoulder, seeing people fire and enemy’s hit in the same shot. It really makes it feel real, in a way that heavily cut sequences don’t always. The colour grading and composition was also exceptional, and all performances seemed great. 
San Andreas 2015;6;  When a devastating earthquake hits the San Andreas fault, rescue pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) tries to track down his estranged wife and daughter before it’s too late, in Brad Peyton’s disaster action with Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario and Ioan Gruffudd making up the supporting cast. San Andreas is kind of a mixed bag overall, as the 20 minute segment about a third of the way in when the earthquake hits is absolutely electric, skilfully blending CG with practical effects for…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I’d cut my fingers off too if Colin Farrell kept talking to me DOG DANCE 8  
Paddington 2014;10; I regret to inform you that this is a film for children and 30 something film nerds are legally not allowed to watch it. You’re all under arrest. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  Olivia Wilde’s sophomore feature Don’t Worry Darling has a promising start only to be failed by its pathetic third act that don’t give enough credit to its audiences. From her 2019 debut Booksmart, Wilde has showed prowess in handling her sensitive themes with assuredness and approaching them with unique energy and wit. Don’t Worry Darling has all of that, if not more ambitious and technically grandiose though pays off in less satisfying results.The film stars the ever-formidable Florence Pugh,…  
Coraline 2009;10;  Es increíble lo bien manejada que está esta historia. Al inicio la primera vez que la vemos no nos imaginamos todas las vueltas que vemos más adelante y cómo el tono de la cinta cambia de un tono inocente a un tono más oscuro.No hay duda que muchos se pueden identificar con la historia de Coraline, una chica que se muda a una nueva casa dejando a sus amigos atrás, y encima teniendo unos padres que no le prestan…  
Beetlejuice 1988;8; Mi. Chael. Kea. Ton. Too much silliness, wholesomeness, goofballatry and chicanery for one man to handle. Baffling, baffling performance. Bravo, sir. Bravo. What an insane cast. They all sat down with the president of Disney Chanel and said we want to make history and that’s what this is 😏Spooky October2022 Diary Ranked 
10 Things I Hate About You 1999;10; shakespeare’s been hella quiet since ms perky’s fanfic of “reginald’s quivering member” 
Fires on the Plain 2014;10;  Digital cinematography + Tsukamoto's trademark gore + war is hell on earth > hyperreal, hyperbolized horrors of history with the skin of armistice stretched over itBarring The Thin Red Line it is difficult to pinpoint another film about war that is as colorful and dreamlike as this one. But despite Malick's work having near polar-opposite execution and tone, both share an uncanny quality of un-reality to them, unreal in the sense of being specifically too real, hyper-real, an exaggerated (or…

Fear Street: 1994 2021;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Nah because how are they gonna kill Maya Hawke in the first 10 minutes and then make Deena the main character, sorry but she was so annoying  
Frances Ha 2012;8;  Frances Ha is for sure one of the most well-written character studies of the 21st century. The joy and pain of chasing dreams in big cities as a youth couldn't have been captured in a more close-up manner, and Greta Gerwig couldn't have embodies the titular character any more in-depth.Frances Ha features the friendship between two female dancers in New York as the central plot, and everything else expands from there. Frances is spontaneous, quirky, but can get cringey…  
Pearl 2022;8; maybe that’s just abby lee miller origin story 
Broken 1993;8; This 20-minute short film captures the essence of Nine Inch Nails and the Industrial scene. It's violent, disgusting, and fantastic all at once. At times, it nearly feels like you're watching a snuff film. I would have been traumatized if I had seen this at midnight as a kid. And, while they aren't my favorite songs of the band, they were still incredibly good, and I'd say the music videos made it even better.TODAY SCHEDULEBrokenRoadgamesOrphant: First KillNoroi 
The Suspect 1944;6;  A man is wedded to his own demons, and trapped by his misery in the self-made prisons of his home and heart in Robert Siodmak’s “The Suspect.” “The Suspect” is a keystone in the bridge between melodrama and noir, the latter genre, in which Siodmak would eventually establish himself as an essential name. Somewhere between “Gaslight,” and Siodmak’s hard boiled masterpiece “The Killers,” lies a man pacing the parlor and the empty streets, followed by his own predilections. That man…  
Overlord 2018;8;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃Not exactly the movie version of the Call of Duty Nazi Zombie survival game I was hoping for, but still a solid aggressive war film with a horrific edge."What is this? ... Our greatest achievement. With it, we create super-Nazis, A thousand year army and it's thousand year soldiers."The reason Overlord worked so well for me is that it stayed grounded as a grisly war movie, all the way up to the point where…

Re-Animator 1985;8;  Re-Animator. 1985. Directed by Stuart Gordon.Re-animator (1985) is a comedic horror film that transcends bad horror. Stuart Gordon’s adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s story “Herbert West, Re-Animator” is one of those 1980’s astutely written screenplay’s that delivers laugh out loud moments, sensual moments, and a take on the Frankenstein horror genre that is outrageously fearless. Re-Animator is audacious and splatter is not a problem. Buckets of blood will pour ones way as the narrative keeps the audience doused in trance…  
Blonde 2022;6;  Joyce Carol Oates's novel from which Blonde is based, starring Ana de Armas in an Oscar-winning performance, cannot be considered a classic biographical report. In fact, just like the film, while tracing Marilyn Monroe's life from childhood to the moment of her tragic death, it carelessly alternates between reality and fantasy, facts that really happened with hypotheses and legends. Similarly to Oates, Andrew Dominik is not so much interested in truth as he is in a fiercely critical viewpoint on…  
Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978;8;  Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 1978. Directed by Philip Kaufman.Philip Kaufman’s sci-fi horror, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) is an intelligent reboot of the original from 1956. The horror genre has a great deal of reboots but rarely is one as engaging as this 1978 iteration. In fact, Kaufman’s version takes advantage of more advanced visual effects and special effects that were available in 1978. The scientific premise of a species that survived a dying planet and were…  
Speak No Evil 2022;6; You couldn't even get me to go to a house in the middle of nowhere with friends or family I've known for decades, there's no way anything like this is happening to me. 
Corpse Bride 2005;6;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃I get it being drab, but this was too mild-mannered and dull for a gothic animated flick from Tim Burton."With this candle... I will set your mother on fire."(Quick Hits) ... Spoilers:- Burton do you think you could cast someone other than Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter to be the leads of your movie ... I mean just to freshen things up a bit for this familiar story- This reminded me…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  It takes two to tango.The Banshees of Inisherin hilariously tells the melancholic story of two friends' falling apart their friendship on a quiet and boring island in Ireland. Colin Farrell is like a slowly exploding bomb at his best. The sad tone of the film is also powerful and elegant. Comparing to In Bruges, the humor is more mature and far from the show. Which will be surprising for lots of people that expect a film just like In…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;8; feasting on that pussy like a goddamn milkshake 
Speak No Evil 2022;8;  “Because you let me.”That line has ingrained itself into my mind. We, as well as the characters, stick around and try to politely accept the increasingly banal and unhinged behaviors of these hosts. Despite witnessing red flag after red flag, the irrational, human need to not blow things out of proportion or come across as rude, makes us suffer through this progressively unruly hellscape of a vacation. Director Christian Tafdrup doesn’t reward our patience. Instead, he snuffs out the…

Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;10; I can’t believe I’m saying this but this puts the nails in the coffin for disney and their pathetic live action remakes. this one has heart, it has charisma, and actually feels authentic to the source material and is just wonderfully crafted. I absolutely love it. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; They were cooking with this. I don’t know what, but they were cooking. 
The Fabelmans 2022;8;  Something about seeing David Lynch acting on the big screen in a movie theater awakens something deep within me that no other performer has ever awakened. It makes me wanna leap out of my seat like the crazy fangirls from old concert footage of The Beatles and scream and jump up and down all giddy and try to claw my way into the screen. He doesn’t even have to say a word. There are very few joys in life that…

Decision to Leave 2022;10;  Not unlike the style of some of his earlier films, like Oldboy for example, Decision to Leave also starts with the unknown and slowly feeds us with information. To keep us in the story (and link different moments), Chan-wook will use flashback resources (not in the usual way, in a much more special way) and genius assembly games that invite us to play puzzle, where each piece will be awarded as a kind of reward for our good behavior, which…  
Crazy, Stupid, Love. 2011;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i love the 'emma stone leaves a boring dude during dinner to go make out with ryan gosling' cinematic universe  
Cursed Films 2020;10;  This review is for season 2For me, the best part about these documentaries that span multiple seasons is how consistently high the quality gets on each new installment.The second season represents a substantial improvement over the first, which was already excellent. Many of the films featured were to be anticipated, such as The Wizard of Oz, Cannibal Holocaust, and even The Serpent and the Rainbow, but I was elated to find an episode devoted to Tarkovsky's "Stalker," with…

Black Adam 2022;8;  Score : 7/10 ✅Aggressively outdated and generic but surprisingly full of action and entertaining sequences, Black Adam is a movie that I ultimately enjoyed watching (my empty bag of popcorn can attest to that). It’s a superhero film (and a DC movie) so I was seeking fun and not necessarily logic and thankfully, Black Adam is full, if not, only of that.Perhaps my first negative to point out is this: There are many characters to follow and I…  
Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives 1986;10;  There is no doubt that there is uniqueness within the previous installment of the series, "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning" (1985). That film carried within it a series of curveballs with a strange ending that was geared towards a new direction within the series. Tommy Jarvis has developed and become a bit of the connective string throughout the last few installments, which works as there was no real attachable protagonist character at the beginning of the series. Even with…  
Rope 1948;10;  The illusion of just one take holds us in suspense for the entire runtime of Rope. There's no whodunit here given we see the central murder right from the start - just nail biting tension as a cat and mouse game ensues, and we wait to see if the murderers will be discovered. The film really is a technical masterpiece - the great Alfred Hitchcock uses his roving camera to generate suspense in the most ingenious ways possible. James Stewart…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; WTF.If, IF, I ever watch this film again, I'll make some more coherent thoughts, and maybe I will watch it again because there IS some stuff I liked. But right now... fuck this.Just like the Jurassic World trilogy, the first one makes a better finale for the franchise than whatever the hell they came up with for the third film.Like, seriously, I just... ugh, what the fuck.My Slasher Movie Ranking! 🔪 
Night of the Living Dead 1968;8; the transition from sunday night to monday morning 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8; Everything before Eat it: An okay music biopic parody that would work way better if Walk Hard didn't already exist.Everything after Eat it: Wonderful. Hilarious. I wish the whole movie was this. 
Eega 2012;8; An insane concept done justice with complete follow through. The sheer ambition of attempting to pull this off is ridiculous and the fact that they did it is even more so. The very ending takes a big dump on an otherwise great climax, but what a climax no less and what a movie. 
Joyland 2022;8; AFI 2022: film #5“whatever i’m doing, i’m doing for myself”an impactful ensemble about autonomy and identity. takes a bold change in direction by the final act that i wasn’t anticipating, but the more i sit with it, the more correct it feels. a wonderful and haunting piece of filmmaking 
The Murmuring 2022;8;  Here's another in the long line of horror stories inundated with themes of sorrow, unendurable loss, and how we all handle those awful facets of death differently. There are distinct instants of terror, Kent has crafted one of the more heartbreakingly frightening episodes of the bunch. My favorite of the lot. It just hit differently for me on a personal level. Andrew Lincoln and Essie Davis are both extraordinary here. There's a scene near the climax that is heart-wrenching, Lincoln…

I can handle the truth.   okay but the best moment in this whole franchise, and the one that leaves you the most fucked up (sorry rue! sorry prim!) is when katniss watches lenny kravitz get mauled as a tube traps her, lifting her up to one of the most audacious arenas the games have ever seen, the camera twirling around her, the countdown beginning so ominously overhead, the sounds of waves crashing as jennifer lawerence expertly maneuvers from pure horror and distraught into determination to…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; Literally laughed out loud in theaters when Talokans first showed on screen because my mind immediately thought of the upcoming Avatar film and the way its trailer played before the actual film made it even funnier. I never fully recovered after that. Also,if Namor want to complete the mile-high and mile-low club I am completely free anytime. 
Enola Holmes 2 2022;10;  Enola Holmes 2 is a dignified successor to the first part! Of course all the characters come back and their great actors too. And Millie Bobby Brown is so perfect for this role, she is such a great actress who deserves many more credits. She makes this film feel so playful with all the 4th wall breaks.Plus, this is now a REAL case that even involves murder. That pushes the plot forward and still doesn't shortchange the stuff from…  
Fifty Shades Darker 2017;4; these films are a lot more entertaining if you picture edward and bella as the main characters 
Snipers 2022;4;  considering this had the sick premise of the propaganda movie that they make in inglourious basterds but for a chinese sniper in the korean war and is directed by one of the most stylish chinese action filmmakers ever... pretty disappointing stuff, and definitely the most stock, generic thing i've seen zhang yimou put his name on. not only does it fail as the lean, gory 90-minute long sniper battle setpiece it promises (there's just little-to-no visual creativity or variation to…  
Lost Highway 1997;10;  🎶I'm Deranged...🎶Lost Highway is mind-boggling, with an excellent soundtrack. Before watching David Lynch's "Lost Highway" you'll need a map. In this instance the map will be Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo", the "O.J. Simpson" murder case and perhaps "Kiss Me Deadly". None explained "Lost Highway" to me, but they gave me some clues to this very enjoyable mystery.It's about obsession, time, voyeurism, evil and the free form Jazz that Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) plays fits this madness well. Renee Madison/Alice…

The Aviator 2004;10; Brilliant, but totally unbelievable. At one point, Leo was dating a woman that looked older than he did! 
Confess, Fletch 2022;6; Some really funny scenes, mainly brought about by dialogue so I appreciate that. Hamm delivered on some lines that got quite the laugh. The Lorenza Izzo and Ayden Mayeri characters are the real standouts. John Slattery was also dang hilarious. He needs to play all the lovable east coast old pricks all the time. In fact, for the sequel, pair him up with Fletch after he quits due to all the millennials being too nice all the time. 
The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946;10;  "Do you love me so much that nothing else matters?"Curated Cupcake CinemaNoirvember #12(Warning: spoilers ahead.)In noir, there's no such thing as escaping fate, one way or another, all debts must be paid.

I would have watched this earlier in the year, but I wasn't going to save it for anything less.I think few would say that the Scream franchise needed yet ANOTHER entry. I'll admit, doing so was a pretty risky move, especially without the late Wes Craven at the helm (and writer Kevin Williamson). Nonetheless,…  
Don't Worry Darling 2022;4;  As a casual, sometime LA Cool Girl, I’m mostly just relieved that their Darling Mag-ass, perfectly centered succulent-ass, fetishizing Palm Springs architecture-ass soundtrack didn’t sully the legacies of my personal favorite old-fashioned white people singers, Julie London & Chet Baker!!! Ok. Lmao. As the last person I know to see this movie, I can’t possibly offer anything new to the convo. All I can really do is give you something spicy to read. So - deep breath - here goes. I’ve only…  
The Lighthouse 2019;10; Look, I’m not gonna sit here and lie to you and say that I “understand” it or “get” it, but what I will say is I want to be strapped up to this movie by an IV. Mainline this shit into my veins. Inject it into my bloodstream. No thinkpieces, only two weird men in their black and white box participating in the most intricate of rituals. Thank you. 
Aftersun 2022;8; Not a lot happens here but it’s more about that feeling at a specific moment in time. I remember vacations with my dad when I was younger and that awkward need to build a connection with him. He has since passed away so this film really hits differently for me.RANKED: A24 Non-Horror 
The Sea Inside 2004;8; oscar flattering tearjerker, yet skillfully conducted and truthfully enough in the ambivalence of warm-hearted candor and honest tragedy. 
Pearl Jam - Live in Seattle 2018;6;  One thing I've noticed that helps me appreciate more bands and artists that I'm not usually a huge fan of or listen to a lot of their music is to watch one of theit concert films. Taylor Swift's Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions and Babymetal's Live At Wembley are two great examples that comes to mind.Now, I like several Pearl Jam songs, like "Evolution," "Even Flow," and my personal favorite, "Jeremy," but I'm not what you will call…  
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;10; yeahh 
The World of Kanako 2014;8;  A haunting picture about a father's hunt for a father with a strong desire for vengeance for his daughter's murder, only to uncover her very sinister side.First of all, I'm shocked that Nakashima made this before Park Chan-wook, as it's so clearly influenced by the acerbic sensibility of that filmmaker. The film's incredibly glitzy and stylized cinematography reminds me of Sam Levinson's work, which is both a compliment and a detriment. One hand, you can't help but be swept…

Whiplash 2014;10;  Really couldn’t help but view this through the lens of my own experiences in the entertainment industry (what is a showrunner if not an idea conductor, right? Right????).It forced me reckon even harder with the intrusive thought I’ve been entertaining for the last 10 years: would I trade being the (hopefully) decent person I am to operate professionally on a genius level and be thought of as one of the all-time greats? The downside to that is obviously sacrificing…  
The Ritual 2017;6; extra star for the beastie being so cute 
The Fly 1986;10;  "Be afraid. Be very afraid."The Fly is definitely one of David Cronenberg's best films to date and a true lesson on how to remake a film properly. The Fly is a very successful Horror/Sci-Fi film. At the same time, it's a very atypical specimen in the genre. It truly does more with less, in a subtle work creating more horror and loathing than can its most violence-packed peers.Things can get really disgusting as Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) slowly…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  How do you break up with a friend?There was a Seinfeld episode that dealt with this question, even if it never answered it satisfactorily. There was a Seinfeld episode for everything, of course. Never one about anything important, that was the point. But if you've sat and watched that show back to front a couple of times, it's amazing just how many times themes from it present themselves to you on an almost daily basis.It did so with…  
Halloween Ends 2022;8; Suck it, haters. This is my fav of the D.G.G. Halloween movies. OHHHHH NO! It's not exactly like all the other ones! Boo hoo hoo. TOO BAD SO SAD! Sorry, nerds! Guess you're just gonna have to watch any one of a billion other interchangeable slashers. I'll be enjoying a movie trying something different for once! 
The Ring 2002;8; Simply one of the most gorgeously shot horror movies. A series of indelible images cast in blue-green, layered with fog, drenched in rain. The scariest thing is the glow of the screen. Pure atmosphere. 
Martin 1976;8; Can’t say I went through that awkward teenage phase where you pretend to be an 84-year urban vampire that stalks women to drink their blood, I just collected used tampons like any other normal kid. 
Significant Other 2022;8;  I almost forgot this came out because there’s been so much new horror released to streaming this month. I’m not complaining, but it’s a lot to keep up with!At this point, I’m pretty sure I’m going to automatically like anything with Maika Monroe. She’s just got that “it” factor in a very non-diva way and I love her. But this was also a surprisingly fun movie. 2022 is doing a strong finish with genre movies as far as I’m…  
Halloween: Resurrection 2002;6; I don't think I ever saw this movie in its entirety. I might have even turned it off out of annoyance on my initial viewing. Today I had a much better time with it though, watching it with Michelle. I really enjoyed it actually. Sure it is silly and dumb and "bad", but at least it never commits the cardinal sin of being boring.Busta Rhymes kung fu kicks Michael Myers in the face for fuck's sake. 
Bride of Chucky 1998;8;  Such an enjoyable funny movie about Chucky and his bride.It’s the story of how the genuine bride of the killer manages to get back the toy of Chucky in order to get him back to life.It has an interesting premise, it’s surrounded by humor in each scene, there are some gore kills well executed, because besides being a couple of toys, the movements and the angles of camera were really accurate to make them realistic. It has a…  
Shazam! 2019;2;  How could he catch a bus by the windshield?! Worst movie ever!! The average bus weighs between 25,000 and 40,000 pounds (11 to 18 metric tons). Not only would his hands go straight through any windshield (or any metal parts of the bus for that matter) but stopping that much mass in such an abrupt manner would turn the bus into an accordion and the passengers would be mush. And why did we hear a loud bang when he caught…

Godzilla vs. Hedorah 1971;10;  This belongs in the pantheon of Movies That Represent What Movies Are All About. So much fun stuff to look at. When Godzilla flies, so does the human spirit. The fact that this used to be commonly regarded as a “bad movie” is just racism. I love Godzilla so much, he reminds me of my late dog Ivan ❤️ 😢 This was Yoshimatsu Banno’s only directorial credit - apparently producer Tomoyuki Tanaka hated this so much he more-or-less blacklisted him. Fun fact:…  
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   MottenkisteAbermals erwischte ich mich, oder vielleicht auch aus purem Glück, in meiner wohl brachialen Vergesslichkeit, las ich nach zig gelesenen Reviews und videolasierten Kritiken niemals etwas über diesen – und hier bitte die Hassenpfötchen setzen – „Twist“ in „Massiv Talent“. Wohlmöglich liegt es daran um das Fehlen eines mir und meinem Filmpartner Stefan suggerierende Twist der dem Blondschopf ca. ab der Hälfte, mit dem Erscheinen der zwei Agenten, kam.

Thirteen Lives 2022;6; 100-word review: Ron Howard’s Thirteen Lives is, as its positive average rating would suggest, a fine dramatisation of the Tham Luang cave rescue, but a definite disappointment for anyone who’s seen The Rescue, as last year’s documentary on the same event wins the head-to-head firstly in terms of suspense, and secondly in terms of the ‘characters’, who Mortensen, Farrell, Edgerton, Bateman, and Gleeson portray rather lifelessly, their real-life counterparts had better ‘arcs’ so to say. Didn’t feel two and a half hours long though, and it’s an amazing story, even if the documentary format so obviously fits it better. 
Ghost in the Shell 1995;8; I wanted to watch this sci-fi movie today because I was very curious about it, and after all it’s such a good one.It’s about a futuristic world set in 2029 Japan, with cyborgs and hackers.It has a good premise, it’s even better when you realize that it was released in 1995, interesting characters and a good pacing. It has some morals behind the story and a good looking neo-noir style.Highly recommended piece, even if you don’t like manga, this movie will be able to get you on the edge of your sit.

Em um primeiro momento me pareceu uma espécie de covardia deixar a figura do Myers de lado e assumir ele apenas como essa entidade ambígua que só surge em momentos oportunos, mas no fim das contas eu gostei de como o filme trabalha com isso numa vibe meio CANDYMAN.Ele rejeita elementos diretos da franquia, mas tenta trabalhar com uma projeção daquelas figuras (o garoto incorpora o Myers,…

All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;6;  The more this sits in my head, the less I like it. From a purely technical standpoint, All Quiet on the Western Front is an impressive film. But there also came a point where I was wondering to myself what purpose it served overall, given as there's not too much in here that I found was already offered by the 1930 film. Perhaps it'd be one thing to commend the realism that Edward Berger aims for when adapting the words…  
Barbarian 2022;2;  Ugh. Come on, you guys. Come on. For crying out loud. I really don’t need any more horror movies made by sketch comedy dudes. Too bad that’s likely about 80% of what’s coming down the pike for the next several years. So over this, “and then” twist-based bullshit. No characters, no story, no subtext. Just themes and messages shouted through a megaphone punctuated by sledgehammer reveals before cutting to black then resetting. On top of that It all looks like…  
Body Heat 1981;8;  This cracking neo-noir helped to bring the genre into a whole new decade, setting the stage for future erotic thrillers to come in its sharp blend of classic tropes and sizzling sexual energy. It plays almost like a 40s noir had it been made completely free of censorship, Lawrence Kasdan (in his directing debut) knowingly referencing back to stories of the past while grounding those same elements firmly in the modern day, I think this approach works best when setting…  
The Thing 1982;10; im still completely enamored with the frostbitten physical horror that john carpenter is evidently perfect for. dare i say the greatest practical effects of all time: the gore, sounds of flesh and tentacles growing out of bodies and whipping around, and even an seemingly innocent shot of an arctic base hallway are some of the only horror around to genuinely unnerve me. every character gets to establish themselves meaningfully - macready's introduction being my favorite - which makes their eventual deterioration all the more disturbing. a strong contender for the 80's horror crown.

The Munsters 2022;4; I’m sorry but the “my incompetent assistant accidentally grabbed the wrong brain for me to use in the monster I am reanimating” idea is such a blatant Young Frankenstein ripoff I don’t even know what to say. No, it’s not pastiche or an homage, it is just straight up stealing a major plot point from another (infinitely better) horror comedy.Also, how did they ever get away with thinking this was getting a theatrical release? It is one of the made-for-tvest things I have ever watched.With that being said, it does have some funny moments and was more or less innocuously pleasant to watch.

Bros 2022;4;  I wanted so badly to love this, but bummed to say it's just not good. It's supposed to be a romantic comedy, but by and large, I didn't find it particularly romantic or comedic.

Enola Holmes 2020;8; In retrospect, it's kinda hilarious how most of the people who trash this film are grown adults who are far beyond from the demographics this film aimed for (teens-young adults). To put it simply, it's a rather simple and predictable plot but still charming and engrossing enough to pull up a fun storytelling. The chemistry between Millie Bobbie Brown and Louis Partridge is cute although a small part of me kinda wish Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter played a more prominent role in the story. All in all, I had a lot of fun watching this and I can't wait to watch the sequel! 
The Autopsy 2022;10;  This was, wow, this was very good! The ol’ Cabinet is displaying some terrific stuff. David Prior only had The Empty Man under his belt before this so there was a degree of “make it or break it” for me and he really looked at his own first movie and said “hold my beer”. I’d have to watch the movie again to say which is better, but both blew me away.This does an amazing job of making you think…  
Nightcrawler 2014;10; Do characters come any more sleazy then this? Gyllenhaal simply owns the screen here. The visuals kick-ass, the story moves like an on screen page turner and everything about it is compelling and thrilling as hell. And that's got to be one of my favorite movie endings! Nightcrawler rocks! A must see!

The Wailing 2016;10; Maybe if you had just bought her those BTS tickets it wouldn’t have come to this. 
Halloween III: Season of the Witch 1982;8; One of the best opening credits sequences, with a chilling Carpenter synth score. Makes up for having to listen to that (effectively) psychotic Halloween mask jingle 7,632 times. Has some great gross out scenes, with snakes slithering, bugs crawling, thumbs gauging, robot wires sparking, faces melting, detached arms choking, aaaaannnnddd coins lasering?!?! 
Army of Darkness 1992;10; No matter how many times the camera zooms in on a skeleton screaming before getting totally annihilated, it’s always funny. 
Bones and All 2022;10;  “You wanna be people? Let’s be people.”Simply put, Bones and All is brilliant, bewildering, brutal, and beautiful, all at the same time. Another movie may be called Everything Everywhere All at Once this year, but in a way, that title applies here as well. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a movie that tackles as many tones as this one - blending dark humor, heart-rending romance, and horrific violence - and synthesizes them all into such a satisfying,…  
The Elephant Man 1980;10;  "My life is full because I know I am loved."The Elephant Man is an extraordinary film.

It blends with other notable performances from Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Madge…  
The Hunt 2020;6;  The Hunt is a conundrum - a big-minded comedy action whose broad opinions and stunts results in a tolerable misfire. The satirical nature of liberals versus conservatives stereorypes can produce chuckles along the way, but The Hunt is  mistaken to imagine itself as a perversely sharp commentary on societal division and political discourse. No. Just, no.As an action thriller, The Hunt is a great past time - deaths are brutal, the fight scenes are well choreographed, and is engaging till…  
Garden State 2004;6;  Garden State often gets unfairly dismissed in retrospect owing to the glut of quirky indie-infused “twenty-something guy discovering himself” dramedies that came in its wake, but unlike some of those later imitators this film benefits from the emotion brought by first time writer/director Zack Braff which helps it to feel sincere. Braff based this on his own experiences while writing, and it must have been quite cathartic to go through those feelings and work them out in the writing process…  
Jackie Brown 1997;10;  It was so nice to just bask in how relaxed (but not inert) Jackie Brown is. I know I’m in the minority, but Tarantino just hasn’t been doing it for me lately. Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs are all classics, and Kill Bill is a lot of fun, but Django Unchained and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood basically do the same thing as Basterds, and the cartoonish violence and caricatured characters in The Hateful Eight…  
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974;10;  Man reduced to animal. Before language, before our ability to directly communicate one another, there was the scream. An instinct profoundly animal, profoundly human. Leatherface's squealing, desperate, haunting even, yet distinctly inhuman. He is unable to scream, as he has been reduced to a sub-human by his 'father.' Coaxed to be dependent on him when really he's doing all the labour, 'you're just a chef,' the other one repeats over and over again to the father, and yet the two…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. 2022. Directed Eric Appel.Eric Appel’s screenplay with Weird Al Yankovic was comedic, over the top, and crazy in the same vein as UHF (1989). However, there was some background and biopic to the Weird: Al Yankovic (2022) story. Daniel Radcliffe (Weird Al), Evan Rachel Woods (Madonna), and Weird Al Yankovic (Tony Scotti) gave stand out performances. Radcliffe owned it. He was so convincing despite his short stature. Ostensibly, his acting was spot on so…

Broken Flowers 2005;8;  "Broken Flowers" is a driven introspective journey to find reason. It plays on the "Don Juan" subtype as one seems to have considerable success in the department of romance within the onset of early years, but yet focuses on the often-forgotten element of life would possibly be like within the later years.

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On 2021;10; During the Q&A, a little girl asked Dean, with a completely earnest sense of curiosity: “Did you make Marcel or did you find him?”To which Dean responded:“A little bit of both.” —She believed Marcel was real even if she knew he wasn’t.Stories and creativity can save the world ☺️

Punch-Drunk Love 2002;10;  When I was 17 or 18 I was eating lunch at this place called New York Subs (now closed) and I ordered my sandwich and sat down in front of this man (who I later learned was my parents' dentist, incidentally) who was by himself waiting on his food. When the waitress came by to bring him his order, I heard her ask him about the crossword puzzle he was doing. "Yeah, I find it's a lot easier to do…  
Call Jane 2022;8;  A dramatic look into The Janes Collective, an underground abortion network in pre-Roe V. Wade Chicago. Told through the fictional lens of Joy (Elizabeth Banks) who’s pregnancy is causing her congestive heart failure and is informed than an abortion may be her only cure. When the board of physicians votes against the exception that would allow for the procedure, she’s left to seek alternative methods. In the Janes Collective, she finds her answer and possibly a new calling. Examining the…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  Score : 9.8/10 ✅An absolute win on every level. Grasp the horror of war and desolation in veracity. Give emphasis to how stressful and inhuman the condition takes its toll on young soldiers that clearly didn’t know what trench warfare meant. Prioritize the idea of how suicidal and unrealistic the endgame of this ‘war’ really is. Draw attention to a stubborn general that refuses to back off and a German diplomat that tries his best to end the war…  
The Favourite 2018;10; well this was.... W H I M S I C A L 
The Divine Fury 2019;6;  Spooktober III: The Haunting of the Blood OctoberThis film was pretty much a letdown. I mean, you practically have a Korean Constantine who also happens to be an MMA fighter who literally fights his a** off. The fight editing and choreography are particularly strong points. The primary demon has a cool, albeit not wholly original design. Furthermore, the film's cinematography is excellent, as is customary for Korean movies. The acting is fine considering the kind of movie it is.…  
Barbarian 2022;8; A lot of interesting spooky twists about.. Took me by surprise.. Loved it!With Justin Long added in you know there will be humor involved.. He was great!🚪 
Barbarian 2022;8; it was good but i expected better 
Bros 2022;8; Saw this with a bro. While some of the humour didn’t quite land, this was a really fun watch. Very cute. Feel good and light. Plenty of relatable moments. Nothing like a good romantic comedy. 
The Descent 2005;10; Enthralling, exhilarating and just simply excellent. And no, as a sane person, I am not talking about fucking underground cave exploration. That suffocating recreational activity will always be scarier to me than any creature in the history of monster movies. Them Crawlers and top-tier frights ain't half bad though, Neil!🌊👱‍♀️👩🏻👩🛶🌊🛻💨💥👦🏻🚙💨⛰️🏚👩🏼👧🏻👩‍🦰🕳👹🩸👹 
Dirtbag 2022;6; I have absolutely nothing against Karsten's YouTube work and I really really like the poster for this, but holy shit was this ten minutes of the most insufferably empty American humor imaginable. I get that you all wanna show the guy your support, but c'mon. We can do better than this. 
Don't Worry Darling 2022;6; The big reveal that happened towards the end of the film kind of ruined it for me. It's a shame because i really enjoyed the first 75 minutes or so. 
Husbands 1970;10; just guys being dudes 
Black Adam 2022;2; Awful writing and editing, where dialogue is regulated to quips weaker than the Marvel lines each seemingly imitate, or exposition drops. This film is ineffective in introducing and building impactful characters. The horrible editing ruins multiple action sequences, from cuts seeming to come from watering the film down to PG-13, to overlong silence after terrible jokes. Plenty of ugly and notiecable CGI which also lessens the theeat in its actions. I appreciate the film still has some gruesome moments though this is regulated to brief moments of disposable non-character carnage. First half has some fun music twists though. 
Black Adam 2022;8;  I had not high expectations going into this so I was surprised walking out of the theater thinking this was awesome. Starts teetering on overstaying its welcome & corny at times (looking at you “nod” to westerns). But a fantastic mindless time at the movies nonetheless. See this on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Speaking of, the soundtrack choices were great, even if a little obvious (Bullet With Butterfly Wings near the beginning was a particularly dope choice). I thought the…  
Kung Fu Panda 2008;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend. … [W]hen you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters, and that's—"Po enters dreaming of legends and legendary warriors, but the movie cuts him off before he names the "one thing that matters," because there is no "one thing that matters," and because the legend is precisely the stuff of dreams. This is what he learns when…   
The Lost Boys 1987;8; some parts of this movie were genuinely so scary. the soundtrack absolutely slayed though. 🕺 
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986;8;  ENGLISH below"Henry: Porträt eines Serienmörders" ist immer noch ein sehr unangenehmer Film, sehr düster und gewalttätig, der in nüchternen und realistischen Bildern das Leben eines Serienmörders in Chicago erzählt. Der Film wurde durch den realen Fall des Serienmörders Henry Lee Lucas inspiriert, der als Teenager seine Mutter tötete und 1984 zum Tode verurteilt wurde. Übrigens gibt es auf Netflix eine sehr sehenswerte, interessante Dokumentation über Henry Lee Lucas und seine Verbrechen bzw. Geständnisse. Sie heißt "The Confession Killer" (Geständnisse…

I've been literally an hour thinking about what to write here, but hey, here we go: I don't want to go around the bush so I'll say it straight away, I didn't like it, I only enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film. And you will ask, why? Simple. A movie without Michael Myers is not Halloween. Period. I don't know when they thought it would be a good idea to put Corey as Michael Myers. Also, are you…

Murder by the Book 1986;6;  Action! - The Ghostly, Thrilling and Often Comedic Tales of Lawrence Gordon ClarkAn odd but intriguing short film in which Agatha Christie, author of the Hercule Poirot mysteries, tries to assassinate the fictional detective she invented, prompting him to appear before her and demand explanations about the possible assassination attempt. This leads to an intellectual clash and the author's attempted murder. At the end of the movie, we learn that three months after killing Poirot in the novel, the…

Rosemary's Baby 1968;10;  “One workday, while we were waiting to shoot, Roman was discoursing about the impossibility of long-term monogamy given the brevity of a man's sexual attraction to any woman. An impassioned John Cassavetes responded that Roman knew nothing about women, or relationships, and that he, John, was more attracted than ever to his wife, Gena Rowlands. Roman stared at him and blinked a few times, and for once had no reply.”- from Mia Farrow’s memoirah! the anecdote that made…

No but seriously, don't ask me why i say that 💀Ever since I saw the scene where Patrick Bateman gets jealous of the typography on other executives' business cards, I've been like: OMG this can't be THAT camp 😭Christian Bale was SO great on this movie, I honestly don't know how it took me so long to see it... The scenes where he comes out naked with the chainsaw and the one in the raincoat with the axe? is THAT ICONICAlso... Can Patrick Bateman give us some skincare tips? 🤪

The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8;  Some things there's no moving on from.Congratulations to Martin McDonagh, he's made the most Irish film since The Departed. Yes, I would want to rewatch it with subtitles and a dictionary for Irish slang, thank you. In this very weird place where I think this is an extremely rare instance of a movie basically showing itself in its entirety with its trailers and advertisements, yet the act of watching the whole film isn't affected all that badly. By that,…

I love the comedic duo of Saoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell, and I love that Saoirse got to use her real accent! she was so hilarious and all her constant movie references were so relatable. the way they used the play within the movie as a plot device was really cool as well and I thought it was a pretty good take on whodunits, I really had…

Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies 2022;2;  Some hand drawn beauty is not enough to tear through the cynicism. This exists to be tweeted about, to be an announcement. More Star Wars must happen, brand crossovers grab audiences (it got me) and the thing itself? It doesn't have to really be anything.Though I am sure this was extremely difficult to put together, it feels so conceptually low effort as to feel pointless. It is a cutesy as defined by committee: put the popular, adorable things together…  
Official Competition 2021;8; So much fun to watch. Good satire, solid performances, great cinematography. I’d die for Penèlope. She's so fucking hot! Her style, her massive hair, & outfits was perfect. She really stole the show.Four stars for Penélope Cruz's hair alone. 
Terrifier 2 2022;8;  “Food’s a little funny at the clown cafe.” 🎶 I hope that original song gets up for an Oscar 😆 what a great song!I didn’t care for Terrifier. Damien Leone who is the writer/director/producer/special effects artist of both films seemed to make Terrifier just to show off his talent as a special effects artist. It was almost like a demo-reel. Terrifier had no story and horrible acting and even with a brisk runtime it seemed much longer than it…  
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;10;  Maybe my expectations were super low but I was quite suprised at how powerful and moving I found this.I had figured that it had all been done before, what can they show me that I haven't already seen, or don't already know. And to a certain extent that ended up being true, but to my suprise it didn't really matter. The filmmaking craft on show here is what elevates it. Every shot, performance, element of sound, editing and production…  
The Florida Project 2017;10;  Behind Halley the reckless mother is probably Halley the neglected daughter.Behind Halley the erratic tenant is probably Halley the destitute daughter. Behind Halley the fiery friend is probably Halley the abused daughter.Behind Halley the hustling twenty-something is probably Halley the deserted daughter.There’s so much suspense in The Florida Project, because while I know on a conscious level that the only thing that matters is Moonee’s safety, I’ve known too many Halleys to ever stop rooting for her.…

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; coogler’s ambition shines so much here amongst the flaws. it’s too much movie and very bloated but unlike the first this one actually feels like an epic, the dedication to real world culture and politics along with heightened blockbuster shit is taken way further than the first, there’s just a confidence here that wasn’t there before in crafting awe inspiring visuals and real lived in places. a movie with a lot on its mind, maybe too much but it’s an amazing effort despite the circumstances. rip chad. 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; missed opportunity for a stellar enemies to lovers plot 
My Policeman 2022;4;  This film ought to warm my heart. Shot and set in the towns I grew up in, My Policeman promised a tragic romance of queer lust and longing set on the southern coast of England. An alluring trio inhabit these fondly familiar locales: the most notable and alluring of them all being the exulted Harry Styles. Even with the addition of a 50s police box, this tale failed to arouse my lust nor my love, leaving me altogether unstirred.Any…  
Smile 2022;8;  I'll keep it short: Smile surprised me very positively, contrary to all expectations. This was a straight horror movie in the best J-horror tradition that worked well for me with its flat, predictable, but extremely effective design. I never got scared or anything like that, but definitely understand why 95% of regular moviegoers get nightmares from it. And that's how I want to rate the film. As someone who has seen over 1000 horror movies, I just don't get scared…  
Wavelength 1967;10; I once looked over the insanely cursed Zillow listing for the Meshes of the Afternoon house but I wanna know about the Wavelength apartment, how bad are the vibes these days and how much worse is the rent? 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  I was beyond confident this would be an outlier for the mediocrity of phase 4 but I’m sad to say I left the theater extremely whelmed. Fantastic emotional moments are contrasted with laughable CGI, so much being thrown at the viewer that they become numb to the conflict, and what must’ve been an attempt to open a bakery with the amount of breadcrumbs to jumpstart future MCU projects just shoe horned into here. I recently saw a photo of me…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  It feels like such a cruel twist of fate that when looking back at the first Black Panther movie, a movie which brought so much joy, so much pride for a lot of people who often are not seen that it’s become a little hard to revisit that film. I can only speak for myself here when I say it’s very difficult to rewatch it. An instant feeling of sadness creeps in as newly edited Marvel logos show over the…  
Call Northside 777 1948;8; It’s Noir November on the Criterion Channel!So yah, good, but not quite great, mainly due to a really slow beginning, but it’s a cool true story, and Jimmy Stewart is good as always. Yah, basic thoughts.🔙 Halloween🔜 Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 
V for Vendetta 2005;6;  a film about the british government directed by an australian dude and acted out by an american woman who made it pretty obvious she wasn’t british.i’ve been curious about this film for quite some time now, my middle school teacher used to always talk about it and say it was his favorite film of all time, which was very intriguing. now, years after postponing my curiosity for the film, i’ve finally seen it. while v for vendetta can be…  
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 2022;10; Talk about MAGIC! Del Toro’s #PinocchioMovie  is sincere with its message about life itself & the meaning of time. Dark + Whimsical This is the best version of Pinocchio seen on screen. 
American Pie 2 2001;4;  40 (Theatrical Cut) American Pie 2 marks the return of most of the cast from the first film. The boys hang out and plan out a big party for the summer after a year of college. Jim (Jason Biggs) starts a friendship with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and asks for her help in preparing to have sex with a returning estranged lover (Shannon Elizabeth). This sequel has even less to do than the first film and again feels more like a…  
The Good Liar 2019;8; Between the cast and this story, I was actually pretty excited for this one. Kinda makes it seem like it’s gonna be a romance at first, then BOOM. We get hit with realization, that prolly won’t be the case at all. We then see how Ian McKellens character operates and how things tie in from his previous date. From there it keeps it engaging, while actually quite frustrating as well. Brings everything together neatly tho and man that ending was so damn SATISFYING. 7.3/10💵 
ERASED 2016;6; As far as the older-guy-gets-transported-into-a-child's-body-to-relive-his-life-and-change-things-for-the-better concept goes, I gotta sayit's better than Mushoku Tensei, I'll give it that much. 
Creep 2 2017;6; he was magnetic.I loved him.He was smart, he was commanding,he was wonderful in all ways.He only had one flaw.He was not very goodat tying knots.This movie just described my biggest insecurity about my work, and I still don't have plans to study proper knots. 
Falling for Christmas 2022;4; The rooftop hot tub in that one hotel that you see in every establishing shot started to drive me to the eggnog 
Black Panther 2018;6;  Unfortunately falls under the typical MCU trap of having a giant third act, having to set up other stuff, having pretty piss poor action and the typical dull gray color palette but I was actually surprised to see a film like this have such solid craftsmanship, performances, characterization and a genuinely powerful thematic foundation. Michael B. Jordan especially delivers such a phenomenal performance as Killmonger and I even think he was snubbed of an Oscar. He also delivered these badass last…  
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 2016;6;  “WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!?!?”This screenplay could seriously be in contention for worst screenplay of all time. Convoluted, fragmented, essentially boiling down to a series of scenes loosely tied together until the final act. The contrivances are migraine inducing, the motivation is all time sloppy, and the ULTIMATE EDITION makes you sit for an additional 30 minutes. That is a film crime that should be punishable. It’s not all horrific. Ben Affleck is a decent Batman and Jeremy…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  This film made me miss living in Ireland but it also reminded me of Ireland's not very nice qualities.It's a simple film about a feud between two men on a small town off the coast of Galway. I think that it's a fictional version of Inishmore, which is a stunningly beautiful island.The humor had me laughing throughout the film. It's the kind of dry Irish humor that I love. But, the film just radiates melancholy and loneliness. The…  
Barbarian 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  55/100This movie got me good. Having seen and heeded numerous "watch it completely cold" tweets, I went in braced for some sort of shocking surprise, yet was still shaken to my very core by the sudden and unexpected appearance of Justin Long cruising the PCH singing along with Donovan's "Riki Tiki Tavi." (Rest of the review, along with everything else I write, available via ultra-cheap subscription. Seriously, it’s as little as $1 a month and for now that pays my rent.)  
The Thing 1982;10;  "Nobody trusts anybody now. And we're all very tired."Tell me about it, John Carpenter! Was this a group of blue collar guys in Antarctica fighting an unknowable alien threat, or was it just an observation about life forty years into the future? Because damn, that line never resonated so hard.The Thing finds Carpenter operating at his absolute peak with story, setting, and characters that are as memorable as anything he's made, suffused with a sense of deep unease…  
Trick 'r Treat 2007;8; Love this spooky, horny, brutal yet cute little Halloween anthology film. 
Terrifier 2016;4; The scene with the hacksaw and the vagina 😂What a load of rubbish 😂😂 the acting was shocking in every aspect, can tell it’s a low budget by a lot of the directing and cinematography. It’s a very strange movie overall some characters are very strange and just literally a gore fest, unrealistic gore didn’t really enjoy it I don’t have an issue as nothing like that bothers me but, not my type of genre think I will eventually watch the sequel however it was a struggle getting through watching 1hr 26 min of this can’t imagine a 2hr 28 min version.👎👎🩸🩸🤡😵🔨🪚👀🔫🚘🎥🎥

Barbarian 2022;8; the way i let myself get attached to keith way too quickly only to be heartbroken moments later 
Paris, Texas 1984;4; Abusive man returns to son after years of being an absent father. Kidnaps son from aunt and uncle who love, care for him and give him a happy, secure life. Takes son across the country to more or less force him on his mother (who also abandoned son because she did not want him and couldn’t care for him on her own), only to then abandon them both once again because he can’t deal.I will not let Letterboxd groupthink gaslight me into believing I have to like this movie. 
Stranger on the Third Floor 1940;6;  The shadows of German expressionism encroach upon the many blind alleys of America, including its justice system, in “Stranger on the Third Floor.”A work often cited as being the first noir of the classic era, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther derided “Stranger” as a melodrama derivative of European films upon its release. While Crowther no doubt meant this as a negative qualifier, it would be an inadvertently prophetic summation of the influences that would form the greater noir…  
TÁR 2022;10; "An adjustment might help. You're somewhat crooked."The level of control, precision, & artful mastery on display in the cinematic symphony that is Tár is worthy of every accolade & award to be received.Which is a lot.Like, all of them.Cate Blanchett is going to win in EVERY film acting category, including the ones Brendan Fraser was slated for...& y'all? He ain't even mad about it.It's finally your year, Todd!🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇Best of 202287th Theater Exp of 2022 
Halloween Kills 2021;8; I have some major issues with Halloween Kills, but I did at least like it a bit better than the 2018 movie. I really dug the nods to previous entries in the franchise, and I loved seeing the people they brought back from the original.Good job making Michael more ruthless, some of the kills were pretty sick.Watching this with Michelle and Sophie definitely added to my enjoyment. 
The 4th Man 1983;10; Man, how I love this movie. I actually think it's one of Paul Verhoeven's most solid efforts. Really psycho-sexual pulp at its best. That makes it kind of sad that it remains so underseen.Some hip boutique label should definitely pick this up for a nice blu-ray release (the Anchor Bay DVD has sadly gone OOP years ago).I always enjoy introducing The 4th Man to people. Today it was Michelle's turn. I'm glad she had a good time with it. 
Ikiru 1952;10; Five stars because it's obviously a masterpiece, I will just say that for personal reasons this movie is a Cannibal Holocaust-level ordeal right now. 
Rosaline 2022;8; It’s cute. It’s VERY cute. 
The Conjuring 2013;8; i’m just saying......if ed and lorraine warren asked me to be in a throuple with them................i wouldn’t say no........ 
Asuran 2019;8; Adapted from the book Vekkai, Vetri Maaran weaves his storytelling magic yet again to deliver a fiery raw revenge thriller that deals with class/caste divisions in the society in its core. It’s powered by strong characterizations, outstanding performances and terrific filmmaking. Dhanush, once again proves his caliber as an actor and this one stands right up there among his best. Manju Warrier, Ken, Teejay and the entire supporting cast deliver commendable performances. The action sequences were executed in brutally raw and impactful manner. Songs and background score by GV Prakash enrich the experience further more. A must watch compelling revenge thriller. 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10; I am the target audience a million times over. Giving it five stars because this app doesn’t go to 27. 
The Others 2001;8;  The Others. 2001. Directed by Alejandro Amenabar.Alejandro Amenabar’s The Others (2001) is a film that we had not rewatched since 2001. However, this was due to lack of a streaming platform. A few weeks ago, we found The Others on Pensive Mind’s YouTuve channel. The brilliance of The Others is in its stripped down, no frills, no Hollywood storytelling approach. Amenabar’s original screenplay was refreshing even during a year (2022) of great new release films. Tom Cruise is an…  
My Policeman 2022;8;  My Policeman es una historia de un amor que atraviesa muchas dificultades, que además es muy sólida y está bien manejada.Tiene un ritmo adecuado que quizá para muchos es algo pesado y hará que la película se sienta un poco larga, pero para las personas que se metan de lleno desde el inicio se les pasará volando el tiempo y tendrán una buena experiencia con la cinta.El cast brilla en todo momento, hasta el criticado por muchos Harry…  
The King's Man 2021;6; No Eggsy, no party.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked6.5/10 
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;8;  An excellent addition to the "Weird Al" Yankovic legend, this biographical parody film directed by Eric Appel is almost unfailingly hilarious. Expanded from a fake trailer produced for the website Funny or Die in 2010, it chronicles his unexpected rise to fame with early hits like Another One Rides the Bus and Eat It to a succession of torrid celebrity love affairs and a notoriously debauched lifestyle. In reality, "Weird Al" Yankovic is a comedy musician and actor utilising the…  
Causeway 2022;8;  Causeway seems pretty cliche at first but the story is sincere and deeply moving, specially with natural performances. Brian Tyree Henry is too good to be true. He is literally turned into a star in front of my eyes since Atlanta. It's really great to see Jennifer Lawrence is back to indie dramas like this. I realized that I really missed her. Probably lots of people would find it as boring because the film isn't trying to entertain or show…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  "I do worry I'm just entertaining myself as I stave off the inevitable.".... yep 🤫I actually can't think of a single subjective disappointment in The Banshees of Inisherin, & my only hesitation to give it 5/5 isn't super solid (but it is a hefty spoiler, so that's all you'll hear about it).This film is drop dead GORGEOUS & deada$$ HILARIOUS. In fact it might be both the funniest & prettiest film of the year (?). Then, of course, there's Gleeson,…  
Godzilla vs. Gigan Rex 2022;10; kino of the highest orderi'm thankful that now G fans can stop theorizing about how every live-action Goji since 1995 is actually Godzilla Junior from vs Destoroyah 
La Promesse 1996;8;  l’enfant du temps - the films of the Dardenne brothers look very carefully into the mechanisms of our times. the „education“ into competition, status orientation, fixation on money and materialism. symbolism meets ideology meets vivid life stories. after the pretty unknown (and hard to get) Falsch and Je pense à vous from documentary crossing over to fictional private tragedies La Promesse feels like the ultimate starting point into their award winning, palm heavy careers.a streetsmart mischievous Jérémie Renier quickly…  
Night of the Living Dead 1968;8; Michelle and I still managed to squeeze this in before the trick-or-treating started.What is there left to say about Night of the Living Dead? It is a classic, and it never gets old.Happy Halloween, everyone! 🎃🧟‍♂️🪦🧟‍♀️🧡 
The Batman 2022;10; Monday, October 31st. The city streets are crowded for the holiday. Even with the cold. Not so hidden in my home, is The Batman on a loop. And I’m there too. Watching. 
Barbarian 2022;8;  am travelling until mid december so haven’t been able to watch any films for the last 2 weeks, but woke up at 1:30am to watch a sunrise so decided to just watch films for the rest of the day, and let’s just say this woke me the fuck up. been really excited for it because of the huge amount of love it’s received but also made the conscious decision to not know a thing about it before watching, which made…  
Pickman's Model 2022;6; I would've just closed my eyes 
Toshimaen: Haunted Park 2019;4; Is it bad that I was rooting for the ghost? They all deserved it to be honest. The film has nothing new to offer, a plot we have seen before but in an eerie theme park. The story could have been approached differently since it dragged a bit and if you think about it doesn't make any sense. There's no coherence here but it checks all the marks of the typical Japanese horror movie. I do suggest that if you're planning on watching it, leave your brain cells aside. 
Novitiate 2017;8;  A film that excels in many ways because of its simplicity. Although there are times when the narrative becomes clichéd, the film does a remarkable job of presenting so much subtlety and helping us understand what may cause these young girls to enter these convents. At the same time, it shows us, in a subtle way, the conflict between the new and the old, the reforms, and how tradition refuses to adapt, partially because of its own trauma. Melissa Leo…  
Bros 2022;8; Fun. Cute. Plenty of laughs. But once again, a gay movie for straights, it didn’t push the envelope the way I wanted it too or as far as I expected it would. But overall, no complaints, a very enjoyable and funny romcom that will delight viewers. See it with your fav bro. 
Black Adam 2022;4;  In 2019, there was a major uproar over Martin Scorsese referring to Marvel movies as theme park rides, that they lack the real emotional connection you get from a film, that they don’t count as true cinema. That quote has never been more relevant than with the release of Black Adam, it may not be a Marvel film but he was definitely referring to Marvel as a blanket statement for the superhero genre, a genre that has moved lately into…  
Frances Ha 2012;10; the small details in this movie are so special. more special than it already is. lev's françois truffaut's small change posterthe andy warhol music used in his movies on the background at the partypaul mccartney's blue sway playing in the background while frances,benji and lev are talkingthe domicile conjugal theme also playing in the background when frances, lev and benji are walking around the apartmentEVERYTHING is sooo special i love this movie so much it's insane

Black Adam 2022;2; With Black Adam the MCU has finally cracked the code 
Chimera 1991;8;  Action! - The Ghostly, Thrilling and Often Comedic Tales of Lawrence Gordon ClarkAfter what seems to me like an inordinately lengthy hiatus, Lawrence Gordon Clark is back into the horror genre. This time, though, the director isn't just bringing us a ghost story, he's giving us something more akin to a monster movie, with a monstrous creature escaping from a hospital and wreaking death and destruction in its wake.In many respects, this is a tale of two halves:…  
Black Adam 2022;6;  Random thoughts:The don't give a fuck attitude while Black Adam zaps the shit out of people was pretty cool.They really made the characters van look like the Mystery Machine?I'm for the most part really into the soundtrack.That Atom dude just looks like Antman in a black Deadpool suit.I'm loving the score, giving me God of War vibes to the extreme.The villain looks like a Mortal Kombat character 💀💀Am I watching Black Adam or…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6; Ira Sachs’s Little Men’s Michael Barbieri as a marching band bully? I’m laffing 
The Invisible Man 2020;8; Five stars if they had played Genesis’ “Invisible Touch” at any point, even in the credits 
Halloween Ends 2022;2;  Hard to believe how bad this is, made by a large studio, micro-managed by countless execs, credited to a writer/director many consider a true-blue auteur. It's like the "Rise of Skywalker" of the "Halloween" franchise, in that we all knew it was planned far in advance as a trilogy yet this final film in it has all the hallmarks of homework the makers forgot about until the morning-of and threw together in a careless haste.Imagine if the "Halloween" series…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  Halloween 78’ was able to take the fear of serial killers, cult murders, and the random violence of the 60’s and 70’s and embody them in a symbol: Michael Meyers. He wasn’t supposed to a knowable character, in fact, the less we knew about him the scarier he seemed. His ever expanding and complicated family history was a product of sequalization, they needed to add more meat (and apparently supernaturalness) to Michael’s being in order to make the sequels work.…  
Terrifier 2016;6; He just like me for real 
Hocus Pocus 2 2022;6; why must a movie be good? isn't it enough to watch the sanderson sisters perform one way or another, huge? 
Mr. Harrigan's Phone 2022;4; This movie completely wasted my time. The movie basically went nowhere. There was no point to this.

Interview with the Vampire 1994;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Tom Cruise as evil gay vampire is one of the greatest casting choices in film history.  
The Shape of Water 2017;10; elisa’s friends didn’t kinkshame her at all even when she literally fucked a fish and that’s the kind of love and support I need in my life 
Hereditary 2018;8; Toni Collette does *at least* three different things in this movie that might fuck you up forever.imagine a supernatural creep-fest like THE CONJURING, but told with the patience of THE WITCH, the emotional depth of THE BABADOOK, and the kind of scares that that James Wan would kill for.curious how it hangs together the second time around (scary movies tend to lose their edge, but a part of me suspects this one might get even better), but for now this feels like a *major* debut.[clucks tongue] 
Zodiac 2007;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  name a scarier line in a movie than “mr graysmith, i do the posters myself” and “not many people have basements in california”  
Se7en 1995;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I recently watched a mini-doc on David Fincher's film techniques. One of the scenes that's mentioned is the famous "box" scene. When he filmed Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, he used a handheld camera as "shakycam" to represent the two losing control of the situation. When he filmed Kevin Spacey, he used a tripod so it would be shot in place to represent him having all the power.I had never noticed this before, that genius bastard.  
(500) Days of Summer 2009;8;  Kind of like if Annie Hall meets How I Met Your Mother.500 Days of Summer is very good in its storytelling, but I did wish for it to be more consistently introspective at times. This also would have been beneficial in regards to the film’s critique of dating behaviors. This critique is done primarily through the film’s depiction of the character Tom, utilizing a very subtle satire coupled with framing the story from his perspective, which helps direct the satirical criticisms…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; none of this would've happened if the men of inisherin went to therapy but on a more important note i fecking want barry keoghan so bad

Smile 2022;6; Here’s the good news, Smile is so much better than the trailers painted it to be. Similar to It Follows, but replace the stress inducing atmosphere with jump scares galore. When Smile is actively trying to be a horror film it’s a glorious, gruesome, and terrifying ride. The issue is that it spends a good amount of time trying to be a detective story, which is never as deep or interesting as it thinks it is. Fortunately, the final 20 minutes reverts to unadulterated horror and absolutely rips. My only fear now is that someone will get the bright idea to make Smile 2: Even More Smiles.  
High Fidelity 2000;8; guy who throws tantrums and gatekeeps music wonders why women don’t want to sleep with him for 2 hours

Ticket to Paradise 2022;8; awesome 😀 
Terrifier 2016;4;  One star for Art The Clown & one star for some impressively grisly gore effects, but that's about it for me. It isn't shot particularly well, the acting is fucking atrocious (except for the reporter woman in the opening scenes), the characters are fucking dogshit, and it's very obvious that the director didn't have enough material for a feature-length film, so you can tell when scenes are thrown in or stretched out just to lengthen out the runtime. Sure, the violence…  
Armageddon Time 2022;8;  This is a tricky one, and I’ve gone back and forth on my score quite a bit, but ultimately, I think Armageddon Time gets more right than it gets wrong, and above all else, I appreciate James Gray’s honesty and authenticity when looking back on his (and his family’s) complicity in perpetuating certain racial social struggles in the 80s. Some of the messaging is a bit muddled (or can be clumsily conveyed), and I don’t think I’m fit to fully…  
20th Century Girl 2022;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   i thought this movie was gonna be cute and heartwarming and have a happy ending but it’s not. i cant stop crying😭 it literally went from being cute and kicking my feet up to being heartbroken and crying in 5 mins the fact that she never got the chance to read the letter and know how he fell in love first breaks me.when he held his tears until the trains door closed and then he just broke down. i…   
Clueless 1995;10; so we’re all just ignoring that she was ROBBED AT GUNPOINT??? 
Nope 2022;10; Gordy innocent. 
The Good Nurse 2022;6; This is a slow burn thriller about a crime nobody wants to take responsibility for. Eddie Redmayne used to be one of my least favorite actors for a while but with the appearance of Rami Malik, I’ve grown to like (or at least accept) Eddie even when he’s in creepy mode. But the heart of the film is Jessica Chastain and she is doing subtle, quiet acting here, which is a tonic after so many over the top (although enjoyable) roles.  And hoping Nnamdi Asomugha will start getting bigger parts after his good work here 
The Shining 1980;10;  "So, Mr. Torrance, you're going to be left alone for several months, snowed in and isolated with just your thoughts and your family that you clearly despise. How do you think you'll cope?"Jack: *responds with psycho death stare. "Okay then, have fun!"For the longest time "The Shining," "The Exorcist" and "The Thing" made up my (un)holy trinity of horror films. These three films are the crème de la crème. The best of the very best. However, a few…  
Halloween Ends 2022;2; The upcoming FNAF movie will most likely be better than this and that says enough

I'm not sure it's really his cup of tea. Harry: (Stunned silence) What? Ken: You know... I'm not sure it's really his thing. Harry: What do you mean it's not really his thing? What's that…  
The Island of Dr. Moreau 1996;8;  Frankenheimer #24Nick's Review.Min's Review.WILD. This is the definition of an underrated film, an otherwise glorious example of notorious behind the scenes casting a dark shadow on the overall opinion of an affecting flick. This is also John Frankenheimer's marked improvement on the horror genre, eco-horror even more specifically (after Prophecy). Though no mutant bears smashing kids in sleeping bags, there is far weirder stuff abound.And speaking of prophetic, this is Frankenheimer dealing with more unbound egos on…  
King of New York 1990;8; NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE MOTHAFUCKA 
Gilda 1946;10;  Now here’s my kind of noir (if it qualifies as one, but it’s close enough for me), a simple story predicated on relationships and basic human emotion with a woman at the forefront, not to exist purely in peril, but to be that object of desire for all within her line of sight, without forceful coercion but requiring a clever courting strategy as a basic necessity to play the game. The losers in this scenario aren’t so lucky as to…  
My Neighbor Totoro 1988;10; *Catbus appears on screen*Me: CATBUS WOOOOO LETS GO! HECK YEAH CATBUS!Younger Sibling: Why is Catbus so important?Me: 𝗖𝗔𝗧𝗕𝗨𝗦 
Full Metal Jacket 1987;8;  Kubrick's brutal statement on war still comes with a bit of his cheeky nihilistic black-comedy sprinkled on top, making it feel like some bouncy expedition through hell. Matthew Modine leads us through the muck, starting us off with a tale so episodic it makes you think we're diving into an anthology film. However, once Gomer Pyle gets his cathartic dues, the film meanders purposefully. It's a structural move that mimics that promise of glory and inevitable disappointing chaos that will…  
Jennifer's Body 2009;8; If megan fox kissed me like that, it’s done. I'm doing whatever she says 
The Book of Boba Fett 2021;6; Most people cannot forget,How much they love Boba Fett.On Tattoine,He's going clean,To make him less of a threat.-----and-----Most folks could not have bet,There'd be a whole show about Fett.Hoping for more,Cause his Rancor,Is really such a good pet. 
The Good Nurse 2022;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Chastain wants to be a Good Nurse,Trying to help patients first.Her boss can't explain,How Eddie Redmayne,Is hired and then things get worse.  
Dobaaraa 2022;6; Though it doesn’t have your high edge of seat SciFi thrills, the neatly crafted time travel mystery drama springs in enough suspense elements at right junctures to stay constantly engaging. Taapsee Pannu and rest of cast put on a strong show. It indeed ends up a good watch, but still am eagerly looking forward for Anurag to get back to his quirky offbeat mode as it’s been quiet some time now. 
The Autopsy 2022;8; *cue the Jigsaw theme* 
Killer Klowns from Outer Space 1988;8;  Killer clowns, what else you need to have fun?It’s about powerful clowns that came from another galaxy to do their things in earth.Entertaining movie, it’s an original one, I like this original concept. I liked the editing of the movie, the effects and I also liked the costumes of the clowns, that masks are intimidating!The pacing is good and the soundtrack is very very enjoyable, an iconic one. I love that scene where all the clowns are…

Lady Bird 2017;10; This movie has almost become a healing experience for me. Full of beauty and sweet sentiment. Devastatingly relatable. It’s like a warm hug. Feels like home. 
Pearl 2022;10; Mia Goth, what a legend you are. I loved the movie, I expected nothing less from it. And can we talk about the end credits? Omg the way she smiles and starts crying nonstop for 4 minutes 
Pearl 2022;8;  Mia GOAT, you will be always a star!Ti West and Mia Goth's twisted and psychological tale is bring fresh perspective of today's horror films. Loved it from start to finish. Ti West' directing and editing, the music and pacing like a dark anti-fairytale. It's like Cinderella' horror version. Mia Goth' acting level is insanely top. Dance and the emotional breakdown scenes will probably enter the unforgettable moments of horror films. And the last dinner scene is definitely reference to…  
Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood 1988;8;  🎃(Halloween Movie Fest 2022)🎃Having not watched any of these Friday the 13th movies growing up but hearing how scary awesome they were, I built up an expectation for what I was in store for and the franchise has finally delivered. "There's a legend around here. A killer buried, but not dead. A curse on Crystal Lake, a death curse: Jason Voorhees' curse. They say he died as a boy, but he keeps coming back. Few have seen him and…  
Halloween Ends 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   completely falls apart by its climax when it drops its most interesting idea/storyline in favour of a regurgitation of the Laurie “overcoming her trauma” narrative that DDG has both already done, and already failed at conveying in the past. it’s a bad decision, even if it’s a predictable one, and it almost derails the actually interesting movie that he’s managed to piece together. this is going to sound like damning with faint praise but I am actually impressed that this…

The story had a brilliant way of building the tension and as soon the scene at the door I was watching the rest of the movie between my fingers. The cast did a brilliant job especially the…  
Halloween Ends 2022;4; A truly weird decision for a Halloween finale to not focus on Laurie or Michael but instead focuses on an entirely new character that we never heard of before this movie.I respect this movie trying something different and being weird but it did not work for me. At least this is finally the "End" right?………..RIGHT?!?!?!?!? 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;8; Muy pocas películas bélicas se enfocan en mostrar la inocencia de sus soldados combinándolo tan bien con la maldad y estragos de la guerra.Me agradó pero a la vez me dolió bastante que sea un coming of age con un protagonista muy puro. Ayuda mucho la excelente cinematografía y la gran actuación de Felix Kammerer. Cómo odié esos finales 15 mins 🤕 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  March 1923. On the mainland, smoke billows from exploding cannons, announcing the final bloody days of the Irish Civil War. In a couple short months, the fighting will end, but the result will fracture Ireland in two for (at least) the next century. The bleeding stops, but the wound doesn't heal. On the small island of Inisherin, another cold war rages, as the fire of an old friendship is doused by doldrums and despair. Whether here or across the water,…  
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;8; himbo colin farrell i would treat you SO feckin' right 
Cutter's Way 1981;6;  "Cutter's Way" is an early 80's neo-noir of sorts, but also at times plays more of a card being a driver character drama. With that being said, it somewhat becomes a hard film to judge, as it has some excellent merits but also is something that partially disjointed. As a result, it feels really advantageous for its efforts with excellent markings of acting but confused on principles of purpose and direction. It often peddles in one direction, showcasing a story…  
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975;10; rocky emerged from his gay primordial juice and immediately cunt slayed everyone in the castle. we can all only aspire to have an ounce of that charisma. 
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris 2022;6; A bit of a letdown I must say. Not much depth and lazy writing. Very one note. It was harmless and cute enough though. Didn’t hate it. 
The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It 2021;6; the movie itself is fine but the true story is so laughable. imagine murdering someone and telling the judge you were possessed only to have the judge tell you they won't even consider that as an explanation, and so you instead imply that it was self defense so that you could have a case. that shit is wild. 
See How They Run 2022;8; As a fan of whodunnits and this cast, I was actually looking forward to seeing this. First off, this really just has fun with the sub-genre and I dug it. Has a cool meta approach with fun characters overall. I enjoyed the 50s London setting. It’s nicely shot/put together as well. Plus the mystery itself had me engaged. Might not be the most original or cleverest whodunnit story, but Sam Rockwell leads it well with Saoirse Ronan and they have a really nice balance, carrying most of the comedy. 7.3/10🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️ 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10;  Like most, I love In Bruges. But on recent rewatch, I decided it works splendidly as a straight comedy. The more dramatic parts waver, but can be viewed as not necessary in the overall hilarious coolness that film brings. I thought Seven Psychopaths was a mess and though I consider myself somewhat a defender of Three Billboards, I can definitely see what people say about McDonagh playing with themes over his head that he didn't have full grasp of, especially…

Martyrs 2008;10; It's so good, but I would never EVER recommend people watch it. Stay away from this movie at all costs. 
Clue 1985;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  kinda twisted how there were three different endings shipped out to theaters. i’d be so pissed if i were one of the 66% who didn’t get Ending C, featuring the superlative closing line of “i’m gonna go home and sleep with MY WIFE”  
Edward Scissorhands 1990;8; the e in e-boy stands for edward scissorhands 
Dead Poets Society 1989;10; the main thing I love about this film is how it shows the importance of studying art, literature and creative subjects/degrees and how damaging it can be to belittle something that someone loves and it passionate about. a film that everyone should watch 
The Addams Family 1991;10; morticia addams, am I right 
Pride & Prejudice 2005;10; THE RAIN SCENE IS THE SINGLE MOST SEXUALLY CHARGED SCENE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVING IMAGE 
Atonement 2007;10; I AM SO FUCKED UP RIGHT NOW BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BRIONY THE BITCH KEPT THE SAME FUCKING HAIRCUT HER WHOLE LIFE?? TF MAN 
Grimcutty 2022;2;  It felt like they didn't spend enough time establishing the look of the creature and the details in this horror. A teen girl tries to convince her parents an internet monster is forcing the kids in town to cut themselves. It’s been a while since I’ve seen Shannyn Sossamon who plays the mom. She tried in this and everyone else, yikes. The dad was too much. There were ridiculous lines of dialogue. And ASMR. Seeing the creature revealed so early…  
Disturbing Behavior 1998;6;  The shitty teen horror movies that are so easy to make fun of are honestly some of the best horror movies and this truth should be more widely spread as gospel. If I were to get stuck down a teen horror rabbit hole - from the 90's especially - I would be just fine.The truth is, Scream opened the floodgates for copycats and the like with its foundation shifting success. Though it branches off in other directions, Disturbing Behavior…  
It Follows 2014;8; It did indeed follow. 
Friday the 13th 2009;6;  Within the 2000's up to the end of the decade, there was a consistent trend of collectively making prevalent horror classics from the 70's and 80's and making rehashed remakes out of them. Now many could argue that many of these franchises had numerous episodic films, which is very true, but many of these were recreations of the characters origins, for a new generation of potential fandom. Ironically "Friday the 13th" (1980) had a few films during this era that…  
V/H/S/99 2022;4; I was expecting a mixed bag, not an empty one. 
Black Adam 2022;8; #BlackAdam  is a misunderstood epic kick off to the next era of the DC UNIVERSE. Visceral & Intense action scenes create such a kinetic time that I loved. @TheRock completely became Black Adam & added much needed mythology to the word SHAZAM. + I CRIED AT THE POST CREDIT SCENE! Pierce and Hodge are so good as HAWKMAN + Dr FateFULL REVIEW CLICK HERE  
Deep Red 1975;8; #SlasherSaturdayLoved a lot of the elements in this one from the excellent opening, the Goblin score, the signature Argento camera movements, solid mystery and some great kills made for a really satisfying Giallo.  Elevator kill for the win, though.  Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 21. David Hemmings and Brad Pitt in Spy Game2. Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon in Sleepers 
Fight Club 1999;10; Sorry, I was instructed not to talk about it. 
Submarine 2010;8; i put off watching this movie for a whole goddamn year because i thought it was a beatles biopic omfg 
The Shining 1980;10; the blood elevator but its full of all the nuts i've busted over this movie 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6;  Show him who you are.Waffling between the highest three stars possible, and the lowest three and a half stars possible, going with the former for now, but could change it to the latter with further thought. I think I'm echoing what most people have been saying about Black Panther: Wakanda Forever when I say that it's a work where its high points are super high and its weaker aspects are undeniable and should be examined. I'll get the negatives…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  It's got its issues (the editing is a bit rough, Riri Williams feels shoehorned and the third act is disappointing), but they never make this movie feel any less epic or emotional. It perfectly balances grand scale action with real intimate emotions.It's one of the most mature movies in the MCU, never letting the comedy detract from the drama and always with a good sense of atmospehere and intimacy.It has a good villain and fantastic performances. It's moving…  
Bad Influence 1990;6;  Bad Influence explores a concept that would be much better explored some nine years later in Fight Club. James Spader is a fairly successful but ineffective office executive, whose life is turned upside down when he meets Rob Lowe's amoral free spirit, who teaches him a few lessons on how to assert himself. It all feels rather generic, though the whole thing is ably brought to life by director Curtis Hanson. The film has the whole early nineties aesthetic going…  
Blade 1998;8;  The Evolution of Horror podcast just covered this and Blade 2. Whilst listenint to the pod, I realised that not only have I never seen Blade Trinity but it has been about 20 years since I saw the first two Blade movies. I was at University last time I watched this film. So I decided to watch them all, starting here.It is very much the style of the turn of the millennium. The long leather coat, the warehouse rave…  
Deep Cover 1992;10; I've seen quite a lot of undercover thrillers, some of them even rank among my all-time favorites, and I'm glad to finally be able to add this one to that list as well. It has everything I've seen and a lot of everything else I've never been familiar with. Gritty, stylish, and nail-bitingly thrilling at times. Deep Cover starts off very grippingly and is always able to maintain the intensity throughout. It's nothing short of astounding how Bill Duke managed to pull this one off so fucking well. Feels invigorating to see it receive the recognition it deserves. 
Brokeback Mountain 2005;10; anyone want any movie recommendations? id be happy to give some 
The Empty Man 2020;8;  I remembered again that you can filter your watchlist by streaming service and this was one that was on Disney+.I thought it was pretty good. The start was great and then it went in a kind of surprisingly different direction and I was fine with that, and liked the way it all ended up. I recently watched the series 'The Devils Hour' and in that, and this film there's someone waking up in the night. (3.03, and 3.33) and…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  By far the best Marvel film this year (which truly isn’t saying much, but this film actually feels up to the standards of previous entries)!! The runtime is pretty long, but with the scale of the story it felt rather earned, in my opinion. I’ve always loved Shuri as a character so seeing her arc in this film was great (even though it’s due to tragic circumstances). The tributes to Chadwick throughout were beautiful. I’m not one to get choked…  
LiveScream 2022;4; Baka dapat kay baby mo na lang 'to.Elijah Canlas, as great as he is, was too Elijah Canlas for the role. The film is a B-movie slasher, the role is an alpha-male douche that deserved his comeuppance. But the baby-boy looks and the self-serious acting hindered the film from being as over-the-top, as hilarious, as camp as it was supposed to be. 
Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo! 2022;6; Opening:Unique set up about a singular figure connecting all these greedy baddies.Closing:The single coolest IDEA I’ve seen presented in a Scooby Doo movie. And they fucked it up by playing it way too safe!Middle:Super basic SD story with a little lesbian flair.Overall:Cool concepts, uninspired execution. 
The Fabelmans 2022;8; Made me feel every emotion. Can’t imagine watching this any other way than in a theater full of film students cheering for the David Lynch cameo. 
Flying Backwards 2022;8; Flying Backwards is a very intriguing sci-fi that would be perfect for a full length film or even a Black Mirror showing, with an origin story and characters that could be further explored. The acting is good as well, and Rachel’s hair is immaculate lol. Sadly though, I didn’t understand the final shot.Flying Backwards was shot, edited and completed under 48 hours. Impressive 
Killer's Kiss 1955;6;  They should’ve convinced Stanley Kubrick to direct at least one of the Rocky movies because the brief boxing scene here is better directed than any stretch of boxing in those films with more realistic looking action, and I love the Rocky series. Visually interesting at nearly every turn, the boxer on the run storyline reminded me of Pulp Fiction and I can easily see this being an influence on QT. A few standard noir elements like frequent voice over and…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10;  I was hesitantly hopeful when I saw the first trailer for Wakanda Forever. It looked beautiful and powerful but I was just trying to not get my hopes up because I was unsure how they would make this movie great without Chadwick Boseman. But wow am I happy to say that this is one of the most emotionally effective, grounded, beautiful Marvel movies to date. I’m so damn thankful that they really took their time with this one. It’s a…  
The Rainmaker 1997;6;  I watched this on the plane and I think courtroom dramas belong up there with comedies and sports movies as one of the best genres to watch on the plane:-There is no visual spectacle of anything epic, so watch it on a tiny screen guilt-free, it's just a bunch of offices, paper and wood oak.-The sound design doesn't a play big factor, so no worries if they handed you some dollar store earbuds, it's mostly dialog and legalese…  
The Long Goodbye 1973;10; Stylish as fuck and Elliott Gould was cool as shit. Loved the script so much, there were probably dozens of quotable quips from Marlowe. The tone was comical but it never dipped too far into the satire, just the right amount of subtlety. It was cool seeing that Arnold cameo too. Definitely will be going down as a new favorite and that theme is going to be stuck in my head all day! 🎶There’s a long goodbyeeee… 🎶Thanks Cory for the great recommendation! On the final stretch of my list now! 😬 
Palmer 2021;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Watching Justin Timberlake attack homophobes is very personal to me.I think it has become my second favorite Justin Timberlake movie (behind only In Time, obviously)I was very moved by the movie. At all times he wanted to go and give Sam a hug and tell him that he is valid and that he continues to be himself. I really loved the evolution of Palmer and I could see how Justin has improved as an actorOh, and he…   
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;10; This is my Joker 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; my theater was annoying and loud as hell but when the t’challa flashbacks were on screen it was dead silent out of respect, and that truly warmed my heart 
Pinocchio 1940;10; Masterpiece. This is very much a story of works-based salvation - unless there are enough notes of grace along the way? (Geppetto's acceptance of Pinocchio - donkey ears and all - has a particular, Prodigal Son quality to it.) 
Frankie and Johnny 1991;8;  The original play Frankie and Johnny is based on was a two hander that took place exclusively in one room, and in adapting for film playwright Terrence McNally opened it up to allow for all sorts of new characters and locations, an approach that really pays off on the vibrant world he’s created onscreen.This is filled with so many colourful supporting turns that inhabit the restaurant our central duo work in, each member of the cast providing the film…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;6; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  More like WETkanda forever this thing is moist as hell  
Spider-Man 3 2007;6; Bully Maguire tho.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked 6.5/10 
High Plains Drifter 1973;8;  Guy in town -  "What did you say your name was again?" The Stranger -  "I didn't." One seemingly normal day a man arrives in the town of Lago. A stranger. After getting harassed by and handily dealing with local hooligans, he is approached by the sheriff with a proposition. A group of bandits is about to be released from jail and the town is terrified that they will burn it all down. Seeing how this stranger dealt with the…  
88:88 2015;8;  An exercise in (what I understand to be) contextualization of the past and present but without any semblance of nostalgia nor remorse. More a recollection, emphasis on the 'collection' as expressed through its nearly incomprehensible narrative and timeline, yet despite this there is a deep intuitive understanding of what it is we are seeing. Simultaneously a home video and a frenetic documentary, my impression is that 88:88 means to blur the two as would living in poverty do: past and…  
The Murmuring 2022;8; Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities- Episode 8Probably the least scary of the anthology, but also the most heartbreaking. Trauma as a vehicle for horror is something Kent has proven to be incredibly talented at telling, but the horror in this feels more like an afterthought. Slightly lazy and mostly predictable, the silver lining is that the dynamic between Davis and Lincoln is so good, it’s easily forgiven. 
All Quiet on the Western Front 2022;2;  a completely pointless film detracting the quality of the original by attempting to be bigger, grittier and more realistic. there's a constant emphasis on showmanship that ruins the immersion and turns the film monotonous, any potentially powerful dramatic moment or tension building sequence is ruined by showy cinematography and long take gimmicks, something modern hollywood war films suffer from the most. it's ironic too, that a film titled "All Quiet" on the Western Front is inable to keep silent, not…  
Attack the Block 2011;8; What an absolute delight! 
Beyond the Universe 2022;10;  não tenho reação... esse filme foi música, foi poesia e como eles mesmos falam uma hora, foi transcendente. não sinto isso pelos filmes de romance atuais tem anos e vindo do nosso cinema então, que geralmente sinto os diálogos forçados e as atuações duras (só ver por esse último aí do caio castro), aqui foi tudo encaixadinho, a química dos dois, o núcleo cômico e não vou nem entrar no quesito fotografia e trilha sonora porque sério, dispensa qualquer comentário.…  
Barbarian 2022;8;  A truly bizarre ride of a movie that tos and fros quite unlike any other horror film you will see all year.About 80% of this movie is absolutely brilliant. It continually plays on horror conventions and the first 40 minutes especially, builds a tension all around what we have come to expect from a film of this type. It's exceptional stuff, and up to that point, I thought this might be headed towards being not only the best horror…  
The Suicide Squad 2021;10; James Gunn is the director who truly understands comic books 
The Banshees of Inisherin 2022;10; Struggling to find something to say about this movie that matches its complexity and elegance. After Three Billboards I was so certain that McDonagh was a filmmaker done with subtlety and nuance, too in love with his own cleverness. But this really is a masterpiece, drawing three fully human characters together and watching them scrape their way out of loneliness using whatever poor tools they have at their disposal. 
Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 2010;6;  Horroroktober die Dreizehnte (13/3) feat. DuBFal-Horrorweeks - 2nd Round - Film Nr. 13Situationen und ihre Fehlinterpretationen Freitagnachmittag, Arbeitgeber Bob/Bobo besucht seine Angestellten-Hallo Frau Unterberger, schön machen Sie Ihre Arbeit.-Schön, Herr Bob?

Pearl 2022;8; your honor, she was simply on the sigma woman grindset 
Midnight Man 1997;6;  Action! - The Ghostly, Thrilling and Often Comedic Tales of Lawrence Gordon ClarkAnd thus our Lawrence Gordon Clark marathon comes to an end with this new and final adaptation of the popular character from Jack Higgins' novels (at least directed by our director). Unfortunately, it's not with a film that does honor to a director who, in my opinion, would have been better off sticking to the suspense and horror genres, where he excelled throughout his career. But what…  
Beauty and the Beast 1991;8; The beast is me and beauty is my boyfriend being very nice to me before I’ve had a coffee in the morning anyway it’s our anniversary today 
Black Adam 2022;4; A movie that boldly asks, what if The Rock, but he can fly? And answers it with a bad movie, in which The Rock can fly 
Nosferatu the Vampyre 1979;8; Why is he so obsessed with blood. Get a grip 
Everest 2015;8; Here I am watching another climbing movie. This one was great. Spectacular visuals, a great cast and completely anxiety inducing. Why do people do this to themselves?! 
Bride of Chucky 1998;6; Tiffany Valentine is so special to me, she deserved a better man! I mean, a better boytoy. 
Piggy 2022;4;  Piggy is a revenge story that's as confounding as it's morally ambiguous. Nothing about it excites or irritates me, except for its ending where too many loose ends remain unsolved.Body shaming is vile, and Piggy confronts it in the form of a gory thriller, while never providing the satisfaction its subgenre requires. Our protagonist Sara, an overweight teenage girl constantly bullies for her body, faces a moral dilemma when her bullies are kidnapped. The story obviously is far more…

Halloween Ends 2022;10;  I believe a film is always about place and time. The events in your own life affect the viewing experience as much as what is going on in the world affects the film's creation. Watch the doc Nightmares in Red, White and Blue for a reminder. You are your own experience, to a degree, and here we are. The LB community trying to make sense of this thing together. For my part? I fucking loved it. I was humble and…  
Halloween 1978;10;  Look when I log a movie as much as Halloween, I run outta things to say. So lemme use an analogy. I'm not religious, but if I had to compare to someone in the bible, and I apologize if this is crass or offensive, but Halloween is Abraham. It's the patriarch of many religions. This is the beast that created something so powerful that others saw the greatness and ran with it in their directions. Much like how Abraham is…  
Smile 2022;4; A24's The Bye Bye Man 
Blonde 2022;2; i never thought i'd say this but.... twitter was right 
Aftersun 2022;10;  Made me miss my dad and think about how he would video tape every vacation growing up and how we have multiple copies of VHS’s at home. About how kids act so much more animated on camera. About how lucky we are to be able to capture something so fleeting. How joyful moments can be recalled with such melancholy. How nausea inducing nostalgia is sometimes. How illness passes on to our children and we see the signs but we still can’t…  
The Batman 2022;10; her name may be catwoman, but i was barking 
They Live 1988;8; real eyes realize real lies........ 
Hocus Pocus 1993;6; Bette Midler didn’t have to snap that hard in I Put A Spell on You, but she did. She did that for us. 
We Need to Talk About Kevin 2011;8; we need to talk about birth control 
The Proposal 2009;10; i’ve asked this question for 9 years. why was ryan reyonalds undressing outside on the balcony. 
Arrival 2016;10; memory is a strange thing. for example, i remember amy adams's performance as being one of the best of 2016, but the academy seemed to remember differently 
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World 2010;10; I relate to Scott Pilgrim because I'm 1. actually the worst2. not good with relationships3. a total asshole4. afraid of confrontation 5. not worthy of the people in my life6. cute kinda ugly7. surprisingly good at kicking ass 
The Breakfast Club 1985;8; im always SO bitter about the makeover claire gives allison she looked so amazing with the goth look <///3 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 2022;6; Jen Walters will have it all,As a lawyer who's always on call.Some trolls will bash,But She-Hulk will smash,All the way through that 4th wall. 
Smile 2022;8;  Smile has the best jump scares of the year so far, and a phantasmagorical ending that I’m geeking just thinking about. It’s going to be passed off as derivative (there’s a lot of It Follows and The Ring in here) but I don’t mind a film, especially a directorial debut, taking inspiration from other places if it knows how to emulate them effectively, and Smile does. It doesn’t nearly capture that same shock narratively, but the story is perfectly serviceable and topped off with…  
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring 2001;10; anyone: *says anything remotely bad about aragorn*legolas: *KILL BILL SIRENS* are you the rightful heir of isildur? didn’t think so! check yourself bitch 
Se7en 1995;10; my mom said that this is the scariest film shes ever seen and she saw it while she was pregnant with me, and im 100% convinced she could have gone into stress-induced labor during the opening credits sequence so...thanks david fincher for coming for my life before i was even born 
The Human Centipede (First Sequence) 2009;4; i’m gonna make a movie called The Human Millipede and it’s gonna be a story about 1000 people linking arms and discovering the beauty of friendship 
American Psycho 2000;10;  The most enduring aspect of this film, apart from Bale’s nuclear chain reaction of a performance, is how smartly it leans on the book’s recurring joke of all these guys looking the same and none of them being able to tell each other apart or even knowing who they’re talking to half the time. The gilded prison of conformity. Entitled duplicates fighting for air in a sealed boardroom. A bunch of men with no purpose or sense of self, trying…  
Wendell & Wild 2022;8; Some of the most incredible, technically impressive animation I've ever seen. But boy is there a lot going on here. 
Holy Shit! 2022;6; Für eine SAW-Parodie im deutschen Scheißhaus, die auch noch ACH DU SCHEIßE! heißt, ist die kleine Genreperle verblüffend wenig "scheiße".Ganz im Gegenteil: Wirklich tolle Kamera an einem wirklich kleinen Örtchen mit verblüffend vielen Möglichkeiten!Das wirkt zwar viel zu oft genauso konstruiert wie die Ausgangslage, ist aber viel unterhaltsamer als jeder Toilettengang. Flutscht. 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931;10;  "I've played with dangerous knowledge, I've walked a strange and terrible road. Help me to find my way back!"No study of pre-Code cinema would be complete without an appraisal of Paramount's 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, for many people still the gold standard (as TCM host Dave Karger calls it) in adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel. The film is not only a superior example of horror from the same year as Frankenstein - similarly showcasing…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8;  Let the mystery foot itself again. Never took long for that. It has been an eventful couple years since we were introduced to this new titular hero: and after blasting off with such success. It was curious if it could again.When the first released: there were nothing but concerns. It was hard to see anything coming from it except a measly Netflix release to fill out their year of mostly forgettable content, but it turned out much better.Similar…  
My Policeman 2022;8; blowing bubbles out of my nose from crying so hard 
Wendell & Wild 2022;10;  TIFF 2022 #12: Special Presentations (World Premiere)Henry Selick's first feature since Coraline isn't quite as frightening as his own take on Neil Gaiman's work, but as one could expect from the same man who brought us said film and The Nightmare Before Christmas, it's hard to not find yourself being swept away by the astounding animation and production design in full force. That said, I think there's a lot to be admired about Selick working together with Jordan Peele…  
The Bad Guys 2022;8; Dreamworks realized they almost made a movie that was too good so they added some fart jokes in there just in case 
The House 2022;8; baby in part one was built different

Sound of Metal 2019;10;  I don’t think I can remember a time where I didn’t hear it.The ringing.The noise nobody but me could seem to hear. I couldn’t stand it. I had no idea what it was at first, but it was loud, and it was getting louder. I told myself it would just go away, but even back then I don’t think I believed myself.When I was nine it got worse, I was having hearing problems, so I told my…  
The Slumber Party Massacre 1982;8; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  There is literally no scene in cinema history better than when they eat the pizza off the corpse.  
WALL·E 2008;10; Bold of Disney to finance and release a movie about a megacorporation that destroys the Earth 
The Talented Mr. Ripley 1999;8; call me by your name, and then i will also call myself by your name 
Saint Maud 2019;10; This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Portrait of a lady on fire.  
Ready or Not 2019;8; THIS is what happens when you wear your converse with your dress 
Her 2013;10; without getting too personal, this film just helped me a lot. when you’re happy this thing can really put you down. but when you’re down it takes a big warm blanket and wraps it around you. 
Lot 36 2022;6; Finally getting started on the Cabinet of Curiosities and I know I’ll enjoy it because I love anthology horror. Even when it’s bad, it rarely wears out its welcome!This was a nice start that looks terrific up until the cgi at the end and even that wasn’t awful. I definitely dug the Lovecraft vibes and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I actually think this should have been longer? I wanted more of the weird antique lady and at least a few more bone snapping squid monster snack bites. Is that so much to ask? 
The Two Marshals 1961;8;  Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciProbably Corbucci's best comedy so far, thanks to the excellent pacing in both the editing and delivery of the dialogue by all our players, notably the international star (according to Wikipedia) at the time Toto (not to be confused with the Brand name, the dog, or the genitals) and, in an unexpected twist, director Vittorio De Sica. As these two men eventually cross paths during the Nazi and American…  
Moana 2016;10; The giant singing turtle seems very familiar to me. 
A Lizard in a Woman's Skin 1971;8; After the first surrealistic psychedelic orgy I thought to myself that maybe porn would have been considered high art if Morricone had musicalized some. 
Autumn in the Vineyard 2016;4; Frankie and Nate are back. Well not really because this is the OG, I started on summer vineyard the sequel. Fueding wine families son and daughter mistakenly end up owning a vineyard together. Who needs lawyers to solve your property disputes when you can fall in love instead! And theres wine, drink wine lol. 
Greener Grass 2019;6; answers the question: what if you remade desperate housewives while tripping on shrooms during a brain aneurysm? 
TÁR 2022;10; Yeoh vs. Blanchett is the best and most interesting Oscar race we've had in years.I was never once bored or checked the time during the entire 2 hour 40 runtime. That says a lot about my enjoyment of the film and the quality of the film-making. And obviously Blanchett's masterclass performance. Possible spoilers in commentsWhy did Tar vomit after seeing those women?2022 Releases, ranked by me 
Lot 36 2022;6;  Lot 36 is an underwhelming opener to the overall underwhelming Cabinet Of Curiosities, which is ironically fitting. Nothing about it stands out, but it's always pleasant to see Tim Blake Nelson on screen, even as a right-wing asshole.A story that's in desperate need of a punchline that never delivers, Lot 36 meanders as we examine, longer than we should, the messed-up life of a conservative, bigoted veteran who banks on a mysterious storage unit to turn his life around.…  
Pearl 2022;8; I'M A STAR 
Bodies Bodies Bodies 2022;8; lee pace’s character is just like me bc at the first sign of any conflict at the party I am going to bed!!!! I don’t have time for drama I only have time for light therapy to cure my seasonal depression!!! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;10; 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is Marvel's most poignant and powerful film to date. It's heavy and dark in a way that it needed to be, and mostly abandons the studio's trademark tone. The craft work levels up in every conceivable way, and the performances rise to the occasion. 
The Outside 2022;6; Annihilation but with cum 
Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 2010;8; What a pleasant surprise! This movie had no business being this good. As self-aware as could be with an exceptionally high level of execution. The comedy hit. The gore and kills were creative and the practical effects looked amazing. 
Alone in the Dark 1982;6; A bunch of criminally insane psychopaths escape from a maximum security asylum to avenge a murder that never happened but they get sidetracked by punk rock venues. 
Black Adam 2022;4;  Adão Negro rejeita verossimilhança na ação e injeta um apreço valioso pela computação gráfica de tal, algo que beira o contemplativo e que enfatiza mais as figuras detentoras de poder do que o poder em si e, nisso, as consolida como algo inabalável e mítico — na medida do que convém, claro — portanto, tão necessário o embate entre tais, pois somente isso para refrear tal contemplação e dar mais moção à ação.É dessa forma que o filme se…

Pom Poko 1994;8;  Furry Racoon balls and boobs were very distracting 😂I’ve never been so sympathetic and guilty watching a movie like this before, Humans are literally the worst. Studio Ghibili do it again with the brilliant story telling and gorgeous animation and I’ve never heard or seen this one before but I loved the entire story. The fairy tale about racoon and foxes and the destroying of wildlife to build houses was a brilliant story and I thought the ending which…  
It Chapter Two 2019;8;  ENGLISH below 🎈Heutzutage ist es sehr in Mode gekommen, dass vor Filmen eine Menge Warnungen und Hinweise gegeben werden. Im Falle dieses Films sollte die Warnung lauten: "Sehen Sie sich den Film niemals direkt nach dem ersten Teil an!". Ich habe mich bewusst dafür entschieden, "IT - Chapter Two" losgelöst von dem großartigen ersten Teil zu sehen. Ich bin sicher, jeder weiß, dass dieser Film im direkten Vergleich immer den Kürzeren ziehen wird. Aber wenn man es schafft, ihn…

The Autopsy of Jane Doe 2016;6;  Horroroktober die Zehnte (10/3) feat. DuBFal-Horrorweeks - 2nd Round - Film Nr. 10Ein Film und ihre Hauptdarstellerin. Jederzeit präsent. Jederzeit das Um und Auf.

Sie einnehmend wie Daniel Day-Lewis in allen seinen Filmen. Eine Performance wie der Ursprung des Method Acting, die Blaupause und der Maßstab.Ihr Spiel wie…  
Halloween 2018;6; I mean it was a good effort but this dragged. There’s no need for these films to be longer than 90 minutes, it completely overstayed its welcome. The dialogue was cringe, the acting wasn’t the best except for the ever impressive Jamie Lee Curtis. I’m happy they made Mike Myers look like an actual force in this film instead of getting thrown around all the time. I liked some of the callbacks to the original and production wise this was one of the best. However, no new boobies being shown is criminal. 
Halloween H20: 20 Years Later 1998;8; Finally, someone made a good Halloween film again. Definitely the best sequel so far imo and all they needed to do was ignore all the shitty sequels and bring back Jamie Lee Curtis. Who would have thought? 
The Stranger 2022;8; aussie police took a little too much inspiration from chris hansen’s ‘to catch a predator’ with this one 
Halloween Ends 2022;10;  “…evil doesn’t die. it changes shape.”i went into this movie with a completely open mind after reading countless reviews & things that people didn’t like, what didn’t work for them, etc. & while i completely understand how it was definitely not for everyone, i personally loved the fuck out of this. the direction it took was indeed bold & unexpected for a final entry, but every part of it fell perfectly into place for me. the movie knows what it is & stays…

The Purge 2013;6;  How to win The Purge:1) Live in a country that doesn't have The Purge, say... Canada. It's pretty close to America, but they still have laws and stuff. Also, they're polite.2) Learn how to hack, like *really* well.3) On the night of the Purge, sneak from Canada into the US. This is illegal immigration, and so is completely legal.4) Move into the base that you've pre-booked from Canada. Hack the shit out of everyone's bank accounts.…  
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  So if you’ve been following my silly little account for the past year or two, you’ll know that I haven’t been the most fond of Phase 4 of the MCU. I thought that most of the shows were just extremely stretched-out movies that end up starting good only to shit the bed near the end, and the actual movies themselves were just pretty middle-of-the-road. Really the only projects from Phase 4 that I would really consider good are Shang-Chi, No…  
The Parent Trap 1998;10; THIS IS REAL CINEMA 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; I was surprised by this one. Me personally I'm not a huge fan of the first one. And I ended up enjoying this one more. Their homage to Chadwick was done very well. Everything involving the people underwater was very intriguing. Considering how long this film is, I was not bored at all. There is also a significant decrease in what people call marvel humour in this film. There are of course quite a few flaws in this film, but for me this is the best things marvel has released this year, so that's a start. 
Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988;10; One of the most inspiringly ambitious films ever made.I grew up with Bob Z as being one of the craftiest filmmakers in the business and this film still feels so “painstaking” in its craft but never forgets the nuances of character (Bob Hoskins is iconic.) and the wonderfully twisty, CHINATOWN-esque plot line that elevates it to pure art. As much as I love BACK TO THE FUTURE like few other movies, this film may be his greatest piece of cinema. 
Crimes of the Future 2022;6; Weirdly... the horniest movie of the year by far. 
No Bears 2022;10;  Jafar Panahi continues to make movies that both challenge the cinematic medium and the state which imprisons him. No Bears is complex and dense, showcasing great meaning and many parallel stories and styles even though the execution is made within limits. Panahi's films are now forced into something experimental, with No Bears mixing various approaches to get around his filmmaking ban. Some scenes just contain him, others are shot abroad with Panahi on call, and early on he gives a…  
The Arrival 1996;6; My dad looked uncannily similar to Charlie Sheen in this throughout the late 90s and early 2000s and I'm sure there's something to unpack there but I refuse to do so.6/10 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8; namor is pretty dope 
Barbarian 2022;8; hope this movie helps contribute to airbnb’s downfall 
Armageddon Time 2022;8;  After a decade of visually impressive but oddly impersonal stabs at Imitation Coppola, James Gray makes his best film since Two Lovers with Armageddon Time, a memory piece and a coming-of-age story so clearly drawn from his own childhood that one might distract themselves noting the parallels. While the audience compares the life of Banks Repeta’s Paul to that of the man behind the camera, Gray repeatedly draws lines between the Reagan era of his youth and the noxious state…  
Enola Holmes 2 2022;8; EVERYONE SHUT UP THIS MOVIE ATE SO HARD

Coco 2017;10; apparently this film had elements that are banned in china but their censor board found it so nice and heartwarming that they allowed it anyway and honestly what a fucking mood 
In the Mood for Love 2000;8; The scenes where the main song of the film appears and the protagonists come and go in slow motion, are a cinematographic orgasm rarely achieved in the history of the cinema 
Edward Scissorhands 1990;10; why did vincent price think it was okay to give this man scissors for hands 
Boogie Nights 1997;10; i love the fetishistic way that PTA shoots the inside of the camera while they're filming their first movie with dirk, the juxtaposition of the stilted acting, orgasmic pleasure, and technical detail. then later when they start recording with video, it looks so uncanny and graphic, ghostly afterimages of carnal regret."there's shadows in real life, baby." 
The Shining 1980;8;  🎃Happy Halloween!!!🎃I'm going to break my anime streak for this bit because I thought it'd be a nice change of pace. Plus it's,, Halloween.The Shining was made by the infamous Stanley Kubrick and is currently one of Letterboxd's top horror movies. I'm quite lucky that I knew little about this film before watching it as it really added to the experience of watching it the first time.I'm well aware that this film is quite flexible when it…  
Run Sweetheart Run 2020;8; Another fitting title would be Men (2022) 
Primer 2004;10;  Revisiting this lo-fi, low-budget classic for Cinema of Meaning Ep. 35Feels a bit weaker and more frail after idk how many times I've seen it and as my taste has shifted over time. But it's still a masterclass in economic filmmaking, not just in practical terms but in storytelling terms as well. The first act exposition and reveal is so well crafted I never get bored watching it even though I know exactly what's coming each time. Perhaps partly…

My Policeman 2022;8;  I didn’t read the source material so I’m not sure how accurate or true the movie was to the book but I think this movie was actually kinda great. I’m surprised on how much I really liked it. emma corrin, david dawson and harry styles both gave great performances and it indeed felt a bit slow at times but I did felt emotional by the end, then sweet nothing by taylor swift was stuck in my head while watching it,…  
Scream 1996;10; think i need therapy cause why were billy and stu so hot in this 
The Craft 1996;8; The impact this movie has on pop culture is insane, like Nancy Downs was the inspiration for Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch visual in X-Men Evolution and Avengers Age of Ultron, this movie inspired Little Mix's Black Magic music video and tons of other things. THEY MADE HISTORY! 
Halloween Ends 2022;4;  I don’t even know what I just watched. So basically a love story that takes place in the Halloween universe…. where Laurie and Michael are kind of secondary characters? What the fuck? This felt like a weird parody, and I am once again confused by every decision that was made.How it should have ended:A young CGI Lauri Strode wakes up on a hospital gurney being taken out of an ambulance, all of the sequels were a dream and the…  
The Princess Diaries 2001;10; this altered my brain chemistry in such a way that i knew i was never gonna be the same

Dreams in the Witch House 2022;4; Hey Groot, yo mama's so ugly, she's playing the witch in this movie! 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022;8;  2022 Ranking A real emotional knockout from Coogler and co. Have issues with how it lays out the conflict/new characters, which bogs things down a bit at points. But it unpacks its grief and love in outstanding fashion, anchored by a sensational Letitia Wright. Give me time to consider this against the original, and I won’t say too much but I think it works so well in honouring the loss but building in remembrance. It takes some less effective detours…  
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2022;6;  Hey, Escobar. Eat it.Would you believe me if I told you a notable chunk of the second half of this has to do with Weird Al attempting to rescue Madonna from Pablo Escobar and his drug cartel, and there's a fight scene in that section complete with one of those "epic orchestral" action tracks (which is laced with accordion of course) and the actual fight scene is really good? I've mentioned it in reviews before I think, culture is…

The Truman Show 1998;10; -The way that director Peter Weir stated he wanted to have cameras installed in every theater the film was shown in, having the projectionist at one point cut the power, cut to the viewers, and then cut back to the movie.—CAN 👀 YOU 👀 EVEN 👀 IMAGINE 👀“Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!”:’))))) 
Paranoiac 1963;8;  "Paranoiac" is earlier 1960's horror/thriller effort from the infamous Hammer Film production company. It features a younger Oliver Reed who really got his start within Hammer efforts. This film marks his fifth inclusion on a film within the company, and although his role is only one of the main characters featured within the film, it does seem that he carries an abundance of its energy for being the quality product that it is. His character is brash and loud, while…  
The Duellists 1977;10; back in the day, two handsome men who were madly in love with each other had to consummate their relationship with a laborious and painful decades-long grudge-match across various historical epochs and magnificent european locales...it was an affair of honor, valor, violence, but before all that, it was an affair.
