# MovieRekomendr

## Overview:
MovieRekomendr is a personable movie recomender system based on popular [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) user reviews. Letterboxd is a social film review website, where users can come together to rank movies and leave short or detailed reviews. Using sentiment analysis on the site's most popular reviews of all time, MovieRekomendr provides users with best and worst ranked lists of the best films that have been reviewed on LetterBoxd. 

## Tools & Technologies:
To implement MovieRekomendr, we made use of various libraries. We primarily used Beautiful Soup, a Python library for pulling data from HTML files. This provided us with a bank of text movie reviews and numerical ratings. To conduct sentiment analysis on the text reviews we used NLTK, a Python suite of libraries to assist in NLP. The NLTK movie review corpus was a useful addition for our implementation. Last but not least, we used Scikit-Learn to test different classifiers, including linear support vector machine and random forest.
